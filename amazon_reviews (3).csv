B00008RW9V,A2XXRN2ANQDBKO,"I've used a California Duster in the past with other vehicles and loved how it sucked up dust and dirt and held without scratching my finish.  I had gotten away from super-anal car care the last few years but with a recent purchase of a brand new 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek, my Automotive wishlist her on Amazon has been growing and another California Duster has been towards the top of the &#34;Really Want&#34; list.I still have my old Original California Duster and it works great (like fine wine, it got better with age) but was mostly interested in this smaller one for the interior.  I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky' to the touch for lack of a water word.  Using a microfiber cloth didn't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.Despite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop.  Picked this up for $4.63 when I figured I didn't have much to lose.Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.So I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.  For anyone having other issues like red fibers all over the place, I'd recommend following the steps I did listed above, it worked great for me and as of now I have a great little duster that I paid less then 5 bucks for.

Have used this in the past on all of my vehicles (3 over the last 16 years) and it does a great job of clearing your windshield/windows of rain and misting.During light rains or when the roads are wet and mist is kicked up from the tires on the vehicle in front of you, this does a great job of keeping the beading moving up and off of the windows to the point that you don't really even need your wipers.  In moderate or heavy rains, it does a great job of keeping the water beaded up so vision isn't as reduced as it is on untreated windows.I docked one star though because i've found (thru multiple vehicles and uses) that my wiper blades doesn't seem to last as long after it has been applied.  I've also spoken with multiple friends who reported the same issue.  I haven't used this in conjunction with the RainX wiper blades so maybe that isn't an issue if you use them, but it is def noticeable with other commons brands... From the cheapest ones to the premium ones, it seems to affect the life of them all.That being said, i now only apply to the side windows, moonroof and mirrors of my vehicles. The beading the product causes helps keep the rain off which minimizes water spots as well.

It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen.  The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had.  After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90% of the water gets removed.  When the towel gets saturated, just wring it out and start drying again.  It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.  I highly recommended it for those purposes.

However, if you pick up some rogue sand granule or some other debris, you could cause clear coat damage.After watching an episode of Drive Clean and seeing them use microfiber towels in the same manner, I made the switch. It takes a little longer, but the microfiber towel is marginally safer on your precious paint job and if you're auto obsessed, it may be worth the extra time. The microfiber are also easier to clean, just wash and dry and you are on your way. This thing will get mold unless you let it dry out completely and is a pain to wash by hand.

As such, I may not have a lot of information to add, except for the fact that I've had this nozzle for at least five years.  I'm not sure exactly when I bought it, but it was definitely no later than 2009.I've used it consistently over that time, for washing the car, hosing off the patio by the pool, washing the dog, cleaning the pool filter, etc etc. It's heavy-duty enough to drop on the concrete, it just lands with a dull thud from that thick rubber ring around the end, and years of abuse haven't affected it in the slightest.  The stream selection by rotating the outer ring is still as smooth as the day I bought it.Being able to turn it off at either end of the rotation is a nice feature too, less messing with it when you're done using it. I had intended to buy another one for the hose in the back of the house, but instead I've just been switching this one back and forth as necessary.If you're looking through these reviews because you're interested in buying one (why else would you be?), get one.

B0001L0DFA,A1OPKNO7IXWV27,"This is a very good nozzle. It allows a good amount of control of the water spray pattern, ranging from a wide fan delivering a low pressure water stream, through to a high pressure, narrow stream. Perfect for cleaning cars (using a medium fan of water to get the car wet and to rinse off the soap, and a high pressure spray to remove road grime from the wheels and underside). It's good for watering plants too, using the fan end of the selector range. If you get it just right you can actually get it to mist too.The only thing this nozzle is missing is a quick on/off mechanism. As it is, you turn it off by rotating the front to one end or the other. This is the same mechanism used to select the spray pattern. This is a design improvement over the original, which only had the off position at one end of the spray selection.The rubber coated aluminum design is very sturdy and will last for years... the last one did. The only reason I had to replace the last one was my mistake... I left it attached to the hose for a few years and either the hard water or electrolysis caused it to become permanently stuck to the brass end of the hose, and it got damaged when I tried to remove it.

B00020CB2S,A1M0M3TOS6CD1A,"I did quite a bit of research before deciding on Dynamat.  There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.

B00026Z3DQ,A2D3P2Q3J0PD7V,I really like the double locking feature as a backup incase the release lever got kicked or something. These stands also have a pretty good lift range. The welds aren't the best like others have pointed out but that's just what you're going to get at this price point. I'll probably reweld them at some point but for now they still far exceed my needs.I bought the 6 ton stands because while I'm not certain they're strong enough to support 6 tons (3 tons each of course) they are definitely strong enough to support any normal vehicle. Remember that the weight of the vehicle is divided up amongst the stands. With the exception of the very biggest configuration of the very biggest 1 ton diesel pickup available most big non-commerical trucks weigh less than 1 ton per corner so even if these stands can only manage a third of their rated weight they are still overkill for most trucks let alone cars.Basically the welds should be better but these things are still very strong and perfectly fine for normal passenger vehicles.,4,Not bad but could be better,1399420800,1,1,Torin Jack,Torin T46002A 6 Ton Double Locking Jack Stands (Sold in Pairs),39

B00029WRJQ,A39AD95B47OEYX,"I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin.

I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.

This one has no particular scent, which I prefer.3. The bottle holds nicely in the hands, it's very ergonomically designed.4. The spray nozzle is the nicest and best (big, sturdy, fine mist) of all the spray bottles I have tried.5. Since this is a cleaner only, you should follow with a leather conditioner (also stated on the back of the bottle), which I find a bit of a hassle.

B0002JMIEK,A2HRHF83I3NDGT,"I am not a detailing professional but I do like keeping my cars looking new. I have bought 2 brand new cars since 2009 and I have kept them looking new by buying all kinds of car caring products. I visit a lot of different car forums and collect the best car care products including cleaners, wax, tire shine etc. If you need advice on recommended tire shine, cleaners, car wash, write a comment. I have heard about liquid glass before but I wasn't convinced that it was as good as people say it is. I was tired of applying wax all the time and the results were great but it didn't last long. I bought my second car several months ago and I wanted to keep it looking new all the time without applying wax every week. I almost purchased OptiCoat 2.0 because many people say it is a permanent coat on top of your clear coat and it lasts well over 3 years. I decided not to buy it because I don't think my car will keep looking new for three years after applying a product one time. So I did some research on other products and I came across liquid glass again. This is a very old product that has been around for over 20 years but the formula has slightly changed over time. The ownership of the company has also changed but the product is better than ever.It's very simple to apply and keeps the car looking shiny and it is somewhat permanent. Since my car was new, I didn't use a clay bar to get all the materials off the paint. I simply used the liquid glass pre cleaner and then applied liquid glass polish. You have to make sure the paint is clean and defect free. If you have rock chips, I would recommend applying touch up paint first because the liquid glass will permanently seal those chips and will be hard to fill later. I applied one layer of liquid glass using a microfiber cloth one section at a time and let it dry for 15 minutes and then cleaned off the haze using another cloth. Make sure the temperature is at least 50 degrees and there is sunshine. After doing the entire car, let the car bake in the sun for about 4 hours and apply another coat and let that bake. After my second coat, my car looked better than new and I am not kidding. It is a white car and it had a deep shine to it. I can tell that there is a layer of protection on my car. It has been two months since I applied the two coats and to this day water just bounces off my car and dirt barely sticks to the paint. I also applied liquid glass to my mirrors and windows. It's funny to see the water sliding off my glass when it rains. It is very easy to wash my car now because the dirt does not stick to the car as strongly as it used to. Liquid glass can be applied many times as desired without removing the old coat; it is actually recommended that you apply multiple coats. The more coats you apply the deeper the shine gets. I have read in many places that after about 20 coats, the paint will have a lot more rock chip protection. The layer will get thick and will protect your original paint from chips. Obviously you can't expect total protection because rocks can fly at your car pretty fast.  I am waiting for better weather to apply more coats. I actually bought a gallon of liquid glass from autobarn.com for around $60. You should not apply any wax on top of liquid glass if you plan to apply more coats because you will have to remove that wax before applying another coat.",5,"After a lot of research and trying it out, I agree with all the other reviews",1392768000,5,5,NA,Liquid Glass LG-100 Ultimate Auto Polish/Finish - 16 oz.,19.95

This can lead to all sort of bad things including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.He recommended a couple product -- SeaFoam and BG44K -- which quickly took care of the problem by helping remove the water and cleaning the valves and fuel injectors too. I buy BG44K when found at a good price, and SeaFoam when I can't; put a can into the Mustang's tank every three or four months, and drop one into my wife's SUV at least once per year.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try.

I regularly put it in the tanks of my 3 cars, use it in my motorcycle, in my snow-blower and lawn-mower.  I saw the biggest difference in the snow-blower.  After only 1 season, it wouldn't start because the carb was gunked up.  And yes, I was using Sta-Bil in the tank on the off season.  But I never ran my seasonal stuff till the tank/carb was empty, I just put in some Sta-Bil and left it for ~6 months.  Now I put a couple ounces of Sea Foam in every time I fill the tank and it not only starts easier, but it starts every time.  I also noticed a difference after loading up my 12 year odl motorcycle with some Sea Foam and a clean tank of gas.  The idle was smoother and it revs smoother also.

In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each.

This pumped grease into some well rusted fittings with ease.My only complaint is the hose fitting that attaches to the zerks. Yes, it is a 2 piece design as many have mentioned which is both good and bad. If you have easily accessible zerks that need a lot of pressure, you can screw this on and use both hands to pump. However, large u-joints can be a huge pain as I can't get anything in to tighten the fitting. I found I had to keep making adjustments then sticking it in the joint until I found the perfect setting where it fit on the zerk but didn't lose grease. However, there were a few joints where I was unable to find this balance and couldn't get them to take grease.

The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun.,1,Going into the trash,1389398400,0,0,Lincoln Lubrication,Lincoln Lubrication 1134 Heavy Duty Pistol Grip Grease Gun with Whip Hose and Rigid Pipe,33.9

I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available. Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this.

This step is the hardest of the 3 and takes the same amount of time to do as steps 1 and 2 combined.  You could probably just use this on your clear coat finished vehicle and get excellent results.  The wax is pretty thick and it takes some effort to apply and some sustained effort to remove.  When you are finished you will have a smooth, shiny, mirror-like finish which is gorgeous.

I tried numerous products and while many would restore the black, the color would eventually fade and I would be right back to where I started. I ordered this Mother's product and applied that to my fenders. I was very surprised at the amount of color restoration I got from applying two or three coats. The black did return and my fenders looked great. I have now been driving the vehicle about three months and I still have nice looking fenders. I also used the polish on my black running boards and the end caps on both the front and rear bumpers. All received the polish well and color looks good. It is easy to apply and then wife.

B0002U1TXK,A3SACPT3TO506A,"My car does not have a lot of black plastic trim. It's a Cadillac CTS, and the only black areas are around the front and rear fascia, and the door pillars. But these black plastic parts had begun to fade after about 2 years. The car is even garage kept most of the time. Many of the black trim restoring products on Amazon have a wide range of reviews; from 1 to 5 stars for most if not every similar product. I chose Mothers because I use many of their other products, typically with good results. Back to Black did not disappoint. I applied it to the plastic trim around the fascia using ""12pcs Waxing Polish Wax Foam Sponge Applicator Pads Fit for Clean Car Vehicle Auto Glass High_quality Yellow Useful NEW"" (from Amazon) which are ideal for this task. Mothers instructions state that the area should be buffed after application. I found buffing unnecessary on the trim around the fascia. I did try buffing at first, but these areas are somewhat rough-textured and seemed to absorb the liquid fairly quickly. Buffing did not change the appearance.However, on the door pillars, the texture is smooth and buffing did make a appreciable difference there. Buffing with a soft towel helped to more evenly distribute the Back to Black, eliminating some minor streaking resulting from application. Buffing also improved the gloss of the black color, which would have been more like flat black prior to buffing. So whether to buff or not depends on the type of material where the product is being applied. Back to Black is also very good at removing any excess wax that gets on the fascia trim areas.Most of the negative reviews of this and similar black detailing products are because they need periodic reapplication. I found this to be true also of Back to Black. But no black detailer is going to be a miracle product and last forever. Mothers lasts for 2 or 3 months depending on the weather and how frequently the car is washed.

Ever walk through tall weeds and get burrs on your jeans?  That's what your clear coat does with dirt, brake dust, and other nasty grime that actually sticks to your car & SOAP & WATER CAN'T WASH OFF!After washing and drying your car, take a small amount of the clay (enough to fit in your palm, knead it so it's warm, and make it flat, about the size of the thickness of a pencil & large enough to fit flat on your palm).  Spray a small amount of the lubricant (that's what that stuff is meant for) and then gently without any pressure slide the clay along where you sprayed.  At first the clay will grab and you can feel it getting caught.  This is the clay actually sticking to the stuff on your paint & as you move the clay back and forth & around, you'll feel it starting to glide with zero interference or effort.  Now, take the clay off the car and look at it.  See the black stuff?  That was IN your clear coat!  Simply fold the clay a couple times and then flatten it back out to the size of your palm again.  And now with your finger, feel where you just clayed, and then move your finger to the next spot you're about to clay.  See?  Repeat until you do your entire car.  Should take maybe an hour at the most.Now it's time to wax/polish your car.  If you have a random orbital polishing system, use it now.

I am new to personal car detailing but have learned a ton from Meguiar's website and youtube.  I washed my car way too many times at the self serve car wash last winter and swirled the heck out of the paint.  I purchased M9 Swirl remover 2.0 and did the car after washing and claying.  This glaze does  exactly what I expected.  It adds depth and really good shine to the paint.  A few have said you can apply this with a machine but it dries so fast I cant see how that would work.  I used a 3 inch applicator and did one panel at a time. I used a very small amount, maybe a nickel sized drop per panel and little goes a long way.  Its suggested to apply this in straight lines and that seemed to work very well.  It dries very quickly, almost crusting over before you finish applying it.  I buffed it off in the opposite direction of the way it was applied and the luster and shine is really incredible.  I used Meguiar's microfiber towels to remove the glaze.

I place product on the pad, lay it on the car and turn on the polisher so as not to sling product. The Porter Cable 7336 polisher is not the most powerful, so when I first begin polishing, the machine rotates the pad when I don't add much pressure.

My cars chrome wheels and fenders and exhaust tips never looked so shiny (feel free to check out the results on my cars in 'Customer Profile images').  Brass buttons on a dress blouse and brass door hardware sparkled.  Simichrome is just awesome.  It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.  Despite all the items I mentioned polishing, I still have ~75% of the tube left.  Just squeeze a little onto a soft cloth, rub on the metal for a minute or two and buff off to a brilliant shine.HINT:  This polish works awesome to restore the lustre on many metals, but be careful when using this on items that are metal plated or made of lower quality metals because Simichrome will buff the metal right off of it.

Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.

B00063X7KG,AYC0EKXYI2T8K,"If you have not used a clay bar, I can tell you that it really does work and it is extremely easy to use. Do not be afraid to complete a few extra passes with it. This is actually step 3 out of 4 steps. The first is to wash your car, then polish it, then clay bar the car, then use Megiuars Tech 2.0 polymer sealer. The clay bar step is actually effortless. You just have to remember not to drop the clay, and do extra passes/wipes, a small section (12&#34; x 12&#34;) at a time. The last few passes with the clay bar you can use the weight of the clay itself. One reviewer wrote that this was too mild and it did not remove a lot of contaminants. This is because he may be missing the &#34;polishing step&#34;. The &#34;contaminants&#34; should come off with the washing and polishing. The clay bar is for removing fine contaminants. Your paint will be very smooth and silky. That is no joke either; it really feels smooth. The car will then be ready for a polymer-sealant or a wax if you prefer.In Summary: Step 1 Wash your car with Megiuars Gold Class (better than the stinky yellow hazy Meguiars Ultimate Wash). Step 2 - Polish it with either of the following depending on the contaminants. Feel the paint. Is there a lot of grittiness ? Then you may want to use Megiuars medium/fine cut cleaner. The medium cut cleaner will remove some heavy duty water spots that you just cannot get out with anything else. If you do use the &#34;medium cut cleaner&#34;, then you may want to use a &#34;swirl remover&#34; after this step. If your paint feels all right (a small amount of grittiness), then a normal &#34;polish&#34; (Megiuars Ultimate Compound is great) will work just fine. Helpful hint. Purchase an inexpensive sponge, not a real loop sponge, one of those large smooth cheapy sponges for $1.75. If you use a round hand applicator, you may obtain a zebra stripe pattern. The zebra pattern means that the product is working, but your fingers are smashing down more than the applicator portion in between your fingers. You need an even pressure and your large cheapy sponge will achieve that. I also tried a large circular sponge applicator for my drill and that actually worked very well and it saved my arm a bit too. The circular applicator for my drill achieved the best results. I had major hard water spot damage that I just could not get out. Always remember that even though the paint appears very good after this step has been completed, do not stop at this step. There is no protection and your paint needs it since you just removed the protection. Step 3 - Clay Bar your car - use this kit or &#34;Mothers&#34;, although since I am writing a review in Megiuars product, use it. It works very well. Follow the directions. Use medium to light pressure. The last pass can be the weight of your clay and hand. I usually use 10-12 passes. Do not be afraid to make extra passes. The clay is really non-abrasive, and almost effortless to use. Complete the entire car. Do not drop the clay. If you do drop it there may be some grit hiding in the clay and you will scratch the heck out of your paint. I have used it after I dropped it, but it is a hassle removing the top layer of the clay that dropped. Step 4 - Waxing time - There are many many decisions to be made on this step. The different types of wax and sealants, paste wax, liquid wax will confuse even the most experienced car enthusiast. Do you enjoy waxing your vehicle every other week or once a month ? Then a very good quality Carnuba wax will work for you. Do you want the shine to last for 90 days or so ? The poly-sealant is right for you. Do you want to use a &#34;paste wax&#34; and enjoy a good workout for your biceps and triceps? Then a good paste wax is good for you. For me I want the shine to last for 90 days with minimal amount of effort to apply and remove. This is why I use Megiuars Tech 2.0 Wax which is technically not a wax at all, it is a synthetic polymer that shines very well. It will also last about 3 times longer than the carnuba wax and it is very easy to apply and remove. If you absolutely hate waxing your car and you do not mind the wonderful chemical smell, the once a year Nu Finish is actually a very good deal. It may not last a full year, but i tell you what, it is really close to it. I have used it and it works very well. It is also about $7 - $8 a can. Be sure to seal it up after you use it though, as it will age if you do not seal it up. But boy does it stink !!!

I might not be getting all the soap off, but I do think it's the filter. Here's a tip for you. When your first filter starts to show signs of inefficiency, screw your next filter into it but in 2nd place. Even if your older filter is only getting half of the minerals, that's half of as much going into the fresh filter. When you eventually start to see more spots than the norm, take the oldest filter off and add your new filter after the flow of the filter that's been there. I hope you got my explanation.

I would recommend however that you look into the Optima website directly to purchase batteries, as they have an offer that extends their standard warranty when you purchase one of their chargers as part of the battery purchase.  You can't get the warranty if you do not purchase them together.  I'm not sure, but it does make sense that if you purchase this battery or any others in their line and you do purchase a charger in the same transaction they would probably honor the warranty extension, but I would check with them first.  The bottom line however, is that these batteries are so well made that they will probably outlast a standard battery 5 times over, so what's the logical point to extend the warranty to two years to begin with.  They're just trying to sell chargers and giving you the incentive by upping the warranty.  I'm certain the battery will far outlast that 2 year warranty.

It can correctly charge more than one type, adn it gives you some good indications of what is going on..... that is all good...... so why 4 stars?  Well, the one thing that makes this more likely to have trouble on the very long term is the build using all solid state controls.This is good and bad:  Good in that you do have so much control and several options, plus it is so very small, compact, and light weight. All due to the solid state control and build.The bad?  It is for the same reasons..... it is all solid state, no transformer and rectifier setup, so it must have the seriously effective cooling fan and thermostatic controller to make it all not overheat - that is it's weak link.  If anything fails, it is likely to be the fan or it's control thermostat setup.  Even so, I still chose to buy them, test them, and keep them.  It is just tooooo good to not keep.  Good quality wiring and battery connectors were a plus.

I used the amount I would have normally used with the [watered down] Costco bottle and the suds were amazing. I literally washed 3 cars with that pail.

It makes a thick, sudsy formula and lathers your car with it. I feel like my cars have never been washed to this extent--it's like a car wash in my driveway.

I used to use wheel cleaners but I this works just as well. Another reason why this has lasted so long is because you don't need a lot. I just use about an oz each time.

B0009IQXXG,A2HD6G443MGH2A,"I'm generally a big fan of the Meguiar's products, and use them for washing, drying, waxing, etc.  Got this thinking it would be a good addition to the lineup.  However, not only does it not really add much to the overall look, but the application method is all wrong.This product comes as a spray, and is designed, as per the instructions, to spray right onto the tires.  After doing so, it does make the areas where applied shiny, but the application is uneven, and even then, because it's a mist, it goes everywhere (onto the paint, the wheels, etc), which is bad.  So you end up having to use something like a paper towel or a cloth to spread the product evenly, which ends up removing most of the product (and making a mess overall).  Then the shine is gone.This product would be better made as a bottle that is made to apply to a pad or some other applying tool, as the spray is too difficult to control to get it only on the tires.Since evening it out also means removing most of the shine, whatever soaks in leaves a dull but darker look.  So, in the end, the best it was able to do was darken the tires slightly.  The product briefly mentions protective qualities, so a star for that, but it seems like an afterthought in the advertising materials, so I'm somewhat doubtful about that.  So overall, this product doesn't seem worthwhile; it's more trouble than it's worth.  It basically made a mess, made the tires darker, but duller looking, and made the logos/letters/numbers on the tires less visible, which in the end made it look less cool than before.  So, I won't be using this particular product again.Other Meguiar's products are great; but this one is not an essential.  It seems like a very niche product that one would only need for special photo shoots, etc, in a controlled environment, but not as an everyday car polishing tool.",1,Not worth it,1402099200,1,2,Meguiar&#39;s,Meguiar's G12024 Hot Shine High Gloss Tire Spray - 24 oz.,6.88

B0009IQZFM,A3B21ZWOW9I4X7,"Let me state up front - I was my car a lot and I mean a lot. Two to three times a week or more. I normally use soft cotton bath towels and change them out as I go so I always have one semi dry towel to remove the last bit of water. I don't have problems with this method as I clean my towels often and keep my car waxed so the system works well for me. No scratches or swirls.But...I thought I might be missing something so I got one of these towels and frankly I really can't see the point. While it might be softer than a normal cotton or terrycloth towel and does soak up a lot of water, it pretty much stays wet after that. You can wring it out, but it just spreads water after the initial use no matter how much you wring it. If you're going to use it as a first pass to soak up the majority of the water then I guess it's okay. But as your car starts to dry you end up putting more water down then was there when you started. Unless you have a bunch of these towels so you can always have a dry one, it's not any better than the method I use now.I just don't get the point or value in using these towels and they're pretty small too. I don't know that it will ever be part of my normal car washing routine, but it's unlikely.

B0009IQZH0,A3B21ZWOW9I4X7,"I purchased these towels to use for removing Meguiar's Ultimate Polish and Mejuiar's Ultimate Wax. Not having really used microfiber clothes for this purpose before, I chose these since I went with the other Mejuiar's products and the reviews seemed decent enough. So I have nothing to compare it too, but these did the job. Over a weekend I applied both the polish and wax on a Chrysler 300C and used these three towels and the one that came with the wax, and did the entire job with no problem. One thing to note though, the finish of my vehicle is in great shape, thank you very much. I used claybar before the polish and wax so the surface was very smooth to begin with. Honestly I would not waste money on nice clothes if it were not.When I was done with the job, I cleaned these by hand in a sink using a little liquid laundry detergent. I let them soak for about 20 minutes and then hand scrubbed them to remove a few black marks. I rinsed them well and hung them out to dry. They seem to be back to there original condition only showing slight wear. I suspect they will last for some time and at this price point replacing them is not a big deal. Oh and the tag comes off very easy, which I have read in reviews for other products, is not always the case. It does say right on the tag to remove it too.I might try a few other clothes in the future just to see if there is a big difference, but for my money these performed well and I can recommend them to anyone looking for a good microfiber cloth to remove wax or polish.",5,Removed Polish and Wax with No Problems,1402272000,0,0,NA,NA,10.09

I bought a pocket hose  to make it easier to rinse my car off after driving on the dirt road when it is muddy . I was suprised how much pollen and dust got on it . I bought some of that ice spray wax  that is suppose to keep it from sticking . Nice product very easy to put on though I sometimes don't wipe it off well and then I get dust over night and I hate to rinse the car because i get water spots unless I spray wax which takes allot of bending and reaching . I  saw there was a super duster that was bigger and I almost held out for one of those but the cheapest I could find it was $30 and I wasn't sure I would like this or it would work . I finely bought this one  it is just fine for my Grand Marquis . It  takes the dust right off and it also removes the spay wax I miss and I kid you not water spots if you rub hard with it .

I am washing with maquires car wash made not to remove wax and  it takes me about 30 minutes to wash and wax the car broken up  in two or three periods .

Thats where I found appreciation for the size and I am very happy and when I can find a Super Duster for  a better price like this week Pep Boys had them for $20 I will get one of them for my hi top van and cleaning in the house  . This one here is perfect for ceiling fans if you stand on a stool and spin it . Very nice product worth the money and if I wasn't at the store the premium would be cheaper then gas to get one . The only thing I don't like is it takes up room in the car or trunk but well worth the cost and  trouble . No problem with lint except had a few strands get caught on sharp edges of trim . Car looks great in just 5 minutes I can do the whole thing . No problem across the hood , roof or trunk  I have 34 inch arms and am 6 foot though . If your worried check out the larger original super duster but I am glad I bought this one due to the storage room . It comes with a case  to contain dust but you just shake it outside  where your using it and everyone says they last forever and the longer they are used the better they work .",5,I am very pleased works as promised great car accessory !,1402617600,0,0,California Car Duster,California Car Duster 62443 Standard Car Duster with Plastic Handle,18.99

B0009VIQ1A,A1R3T01MVZU6Z5,"The California Car Duster is the best quick duster I have ever come across. This thing lasts years. Dare I say, its dusting abilities have gotten even better over time. Mine is like 5 years old and I have used it on numerous vehicles, and it works great for removing dry dust and powdery films on cars without leaving any streaking behind. It takes less than a minute to do the entire car (even the windows) and it really does make a big difference, especially if your car gets covered in pollen. This duster will most likely become a vital part of your car care routine because it can be used regardless of what you do to wash/polish/wax; you just use this for a quick clean up.  I actually bought the combo exterior duster and interior duster.HINTS: Only use this when dry, getting this wet will streak the wipes. Also keep the brush in the supplied case because the brush itself will get dusty if left exposed.",5,Review after 5 years: The best car duster!,1401494400,0,0,California Car Duster,California Car Duster 62443 Standard Car Duster with Plastic Handle,18.99

B0009VIQ1A,A1OPKNO7IXWV27,"This is a great quick dusting tool if you are like me and try to take care of the paint on your car.I do a quick dusting with this before covering up the car at night. I use a CalCar Cover (Noah) to reduce sun damage and do a quick wipe to remove dust from the day before pulling the cover over. This will help reduce scratches in the clear coat and paint. These dusters are good when pollen is in the air too, but I would recommend being careful not to try and wipe down too much pollen. The yarn on this duster is soaked in wax so things will stick to them. Although they say to shake out the brush after wiping down the car, I wouldn't want to overload the duster and risk scratches down the road. These dusters last a long time, and are effective even when they've got a few years of dirt/dust on them, so maybe I'm being a little over cautious. However, I've been using my original duster for 13 years and just got a second, new one, this past month. The new dusters are a little lower in quality, seeming to have less yarn and are a little lighter, but they appear to be just as effective as the older ones. They come with a plastic sleeve to store it in, which is very handy to keep the duster from getting messed up when not in use.Be aware the duster needs to be &#34;seasoned&#34; after purchasing. This means that the first few times you use it you may get some streaks from the wax on your paint. The wax comes off easily with a microfiber cloth. This wax streaking will stop after the first few uses.Also you should NEVER use it on a hot surface (like a car left in the sun or on a hot hood/engine cover after driving). Wipe the dust off in the shade or in the evening and after the engine has had time to cool off.Finally, don't use this to replace washing your vehicle. If you have a clean car to start with then this will help keep it clean/dust free longer. It's only designed to take off a light layer of dust on the paint and glass surfaces. This dust will usually collect on the flat horizontal areas, so that and the top edges are the places you'll most frequently use it. Use care and try to avoid wiping behind the wheels where road dirt kicks up. You don't want this duster getting tar and other oily grime on it. I can't say how good it is with beach/sand dust since that's a lot sharper/more damaging and heavier. Maybe other reviewers have commented on that elsewhere.I'd also recommend the mini duster (search Amazon for California mini duster). It's a great complement to the full size one, but perfectly sized for a quick wipe of the dashboard, door sills and other smaller, less dusty areas.",5,Perfect for cars stored in a garage or for cars that get covered nightly,1388880000,0,0,California Car Duster,California Car Duster 62443 Standard Car Duster with Plastic Handle,18.99

I've seen every scary, unimaginable tow method.  And, I've seen people use things that were not designed for pulling like cables and chains.  Misuse of these items can seriously injure and kill people, as well as do major damage to vehicles.

B000AA4RWM,AC6Z7DP1Z5GHD,"This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.",5,One of the better levels.,1405296000,0,0,Hopkins,Hopkins 08525 Graduated Level,9.95

This is how the world works.  Failure to install something whre this product is needed will cost you dearly down the road.

B000AME50O,AYC0EKXYI2T8K,"If you want a good shine that will last because you hate waxing your car, then this is for you. I used it and it really did almost last for a year. I would say maybe 6-8 months or so. That is pretty good and close to a year. Be sure that your car is as clean as possible, you may want to use a polish before using this, but you are probably lazy since you hate waxing your car, so you can use this right after your car is washed. If you want to do the once over on your paint, once a year, I would recommend the following: Wash your car using Meguiars Gold Class; it is an excellent shampoo and conditioner for your car. Clay bar your car. The clay bar is probably the easiest product to use. It is almost effortless. You mist a section 18&#34; x 18&#34; with a quick detailer (yes Meguiars has an excellent quick detailer), then you use the clay bar with medium pressure. Make about 10 passes. Then you lightly wipe dry. Your paint will be very slick and you should not feel any grit after using it. Do NOT drop the clay or you may scratch the heck out of your paint.You have to throw it out and use a fresh clay bar. After you have completed the entire car with the clay bar, you can then use a polish. Yes I know Nu finish states that it is a polish, but we will pretend it is a protectant. Use a polish (similar to Meguiars polish - yes I love Meguiars products and no I do not have stock in the company). Then you can apply the Nu finish. One reviewer said to dampen the applicator; that is probably a good idea. Do one section at a time. As with any &#34;protectant products&#34; if you use too much it will be difficult to remove. Since you are going to be doing this once every 6-8 months, take the extra time and effort to do it correctly. After the Nu finish, may I suggest that you use Meguiars NXT 2.0. It is a polymer sealant that works very well. In summary:  Wash, Clay Bar, Polish, Nu Finish, and the optional poly sealant. If you are very lazy you can do your car in 2 steps. Drive it through the expensive car wash, and then use the Nu Finish. Good luck.",4,It work very well,1389398400,2,2,Nu Finish,Nu Finish Paste Car Polish,12.51

Goes on, wipes off easy - or about the same as other paste waxes I've used. Oh, and yes, this is a polish not a cleaner. If your paint is really dirty, faded, etc, then you need to use a cleaner first then a polish. Put it on thin, in the shade, keep it off plastic, use a microfiber cloth - in other words follow the directions and use it correctly and it works great.

B000AME50O,ABFRXP3N28UUF,"I use this particular Nu Finish brand on my girl's vehicle. I personally use turtle wax hard shell for my own vehicles, but i notice alot of people seem to carry over what their parents use on their vehicles and well I see that holds true for me (dad used turtle wax) and my girl (her parents used nu finish). So she wanted me to apply this to her vehicle and i must admit, its an excellent product and seems to last longer than the turtle wax hard shell i use. Gives a great shine and there is enough in the container to do her 2000 Lincoln, which is a pretty good sized vehicle, about 3-4 times.I also see alot of people applying this product incorrectly as with turtle wax, you folks got to apply this stuff in sections, let it haze (dry), then wax off. Most auto detailers recommend a 2x2 section, so if you go above that foot print of a section - yes expect it to be very hard to remove and it will also have 'flakes' due to the over dried, over application of the product. You don't have to use alot of this stuff to do a section at a time, matter fact thin layer on the application pad is better. A little goes a long way.Another thing people may mistake about this product, its not a polish as its name says, more of a sealant/protectant, because it doesn't have any kind of cutting like a traditional polish does, so it won't remove minor scratches and whatnot, but it will give your paint protection from the elements for atleast 6 months. I'd like to say this paste would probably provide longer protection if you treated it like the liquid, because the liquid version directions are different than the paste in the fact that on the liquid it says to do one coat, then 30 days later do another, never tried it with the paste version though and it doesn't say that on the paste version instructions either, which is fine by me - i'll simply do a coat on her car every 6 months and it stays pretty well protected.",5,Great finish!,1391817600,0,0,Nu Finish,Nu Finish Paste Car Polish,12.51

Best for protection (it's about 100 times harder than wax) ease of applying, ease of removing etc. Used it for 24 years now on my 90 Camry. Before that on my 83 Mazda. It last WAY LONGER than all the high priced garbage that is out there. Only caveat. Unlike Nu-Finish liquid  (which I also like) you must only do ONE PART of your car at a time with the paste. Just rub it on in a circular motion on about a 2 square feet area, wait about ONE minute, then rub it off. If you leave it longer, you will get an uneven look. Once you learn to do it this way, it will look perfect EVERY tie. I do all my cars twice per year with this stuff. I go to car washes all year. Then, come spring and summer, it's time for two more coats of Nu-Finish. My 90 Camry STILL looks great. (I did clay bar it this year to really smooth out the finish and THEN used Nu-Finish). Bottom line, it is NOT wax Cars today use plastic clear coat. Was was for lacquer finishes of yesteryear. Clear Coats fair MUCH better with a Polymer NON-wax polish like Nu-Finish.

B000B68V6I,A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,"In 2005 - 2006, after the wonderfully intelligent folks in Washington DC decided to require that gasoline must be cut with ethanol, classic cars starting breaking down like crazy. About the same time I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling in my 2005 Mustang GT. Strange coincidence? Nope...Our mechanics found no problems... they basically told us that Ethanol sucks. To be more exact, Ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of water vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down. This then leads to all sorts of bad things happening inside your engine including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.Ethanol is really just a form of alcohol produced from distilling plant matter, and that alcohol picked up other decades-old particulates in the gas tanks and fuel lines of the classic cars... moving all that old junk to fuel filters and engines, causing them to clog and seize. Alcohol also breaks down plastics and many rubbers, including those used in gas and oil lines & hoses of most lawn equipment and many older vehicles. What a mess.We belonged to a classic car club at the time and our club mechanics recommended a two pronged attack on Ethanol's detrimental effects: (a) regular use of STA-BIL to remove moisture from the tank & line while stabilizing the Ethanol in the tank to minimize further moisture production; and (b) periodic application of a fuel system cleaner like SeaFoam or BG44K (our choice, which I have used every three or four months since).Our mechanic recommended using the standard or marine versions of STA-BIL in our cars, noting that both worked but the marine version was stronger (but you do pay a bit more for it and it can be tough to find). We continue to use both types of STA-BIL to remove moisture and BG44K to clean the system and enhance performance, and both my Mustang and our 1930 Ford Model A seem to run much smoother.Thankfully, the EPA has now recognized that data actually shows ethanol is not as environmentally friendly as ethanol advocates claimed it would be (surprise, surprise... look who made money on that scheme). The EPA has now cut back Ethanol requirements starting 2014. Even if the EPA gets rid of the Ethanol requirement, STA-BIL and BG44K have proven their worth to us and we will continue using them from now on.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try. Totally recommended based on our experiences in the cars we have owned.Go for it.",5,STA-BIL Fuel Stabilizer - 8 oz - Ethanol Fuel Treatment - Works to offset the damage that Ethanol does,1397952000,0,0,NA,NA,20.99

Paint adheres well (proper surface prep is always required.)  My only reservation with it is that you must apply all the coats that may be required within 1 hour.  After that, you need to wait a week before re-coating.  I found that there was no option to sand between coats if sanding looked to be necessary.  It takes well over an hour before this paint can be sanded, then a week (per the instructions) needs to elapse before you can apply more coats.  I had this situation in two small areas.  Admittedly, I could have done a better preparation for painting, but it was still a pain to wait a week to complete the work.With proper prep, this is a good paint, and great color match for the Ariens.

I tested the voltage at times while charging and it never went above 12.5v. I do not believe that this is a reliable charger so I returned it for a older model SE-5212A. I have used Midtronics products so I understand the microprocessors and there quirks but nothing beats the old tried and true charges that have metal cases and transformers. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this it's junk. P.S it's 3/12 Amp not 3/6/12 Amp. This charger works if you have a battery that is weak but if your battery is under 9 volts you have to keep unplugging it and start over and over until it reaches a threshold to maintain it. The cooling fan does not run all the time and the unit over heats and then I would have to let it cool down and start over again.,1,Very Disappointed & Returned,1392163200,4,5,Schumacher,Schumacher SC-1200A/CA SpeedCharge 3/6/12 Amp Charger/Maintainer/Tester,52.48

B000C11PYW,A198CCH4NNLI2E,"I got a small construction staple stuck in my tire. Right on the tread, small holes. Exactly what this product is designed for. I followed the directions to a 'T', the Slime ""clotted"" in the hole and stopped the leak, and then I drove a few miles slowly to get the stuff well distributed in the tire. I measured the pressure over a few hours and it held. The next day I drove to work and when I came to my car that evening, the tire was flat. Lost pressure faster than when I had the staple in. It's been extremely cold here (Boston in February) and we've got a lot of snow, so my guess is that this stuff doesn't work too well in those conditions.I know people seem to have good luck with this, but I figured it would be useful to temper things a bit with the perspective of somebody for whom this product didn't work at all. Most importantly, watch out when using this in very cold weather.One more thing: if you look at the reviews you'll see that's it's pretty much either 5 stars (worked for people) or 1 star (didn't at all) with not much in between. It appears to work for about 3 out of 4 people, resulting in a pretty high average review (hence the four star overall rating). And that's assuming the Slime people are uncommonly honest and don't post false positive reviews. Put another way, THERE IS AT LEAST a 25% CHANCE THIS PRODUCT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR YOU. A 25% chance this will cause you far more trouble than if you'd just had the tire patched or used a more conventional tire sealnt, and that will make you deeply regret buying this. I'd actually say that for a product like this a 25% chance of failure is WAY too high. So, consider the 4/5 star review in that context. 4/5 might be a good rating for a TV, but for a product that is fixing something as important to your safety as a car tire, having a 3:1 ratio of five to one star reviews actually isn't that great.",1,Works great...

A genuine AC Delco part, top quality, installed perfectly, works perfectly, and saved me money over other online discount car parts places, and saved me hundreds over the repair shops. This part is for my Silverado 1500 with 221,000 miles. Engine and trans fine. I've been replacing sensors and some accessory parts as required since about 200,000 miles. Truck looks and runs like new. I have never had a bad or incorrect part from Amazon. I use their &#34;My Garage&#34; feature that remembers my truck, and tells me which parts are for my engine. I like that a lot, as well as the cost savings and delivery. This tensioner part is genuine, works perfectly, and is quiet as new! I recommend it. As an aside, on my Silverado, to access the drive belt and these accessories on the front of the motor, you have to remove the air duct (2 ring clamps), and the upper radiator shroud (6 plastic push-pins, and two small bolts).

B000CITK8S,A1E752HE229Q0Y,I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment.

The best feature in my opinion is the quick connect.  Yes the cheap one at department store has it as well but this one floats instead of trickle charge.  I asked a professor at my local college I am attending and he said it is definitely better than trickle charge due to the trickle charge stressing the battery and chancing over charge.  The unit does get a little warm not overly though.  I highly recommend adding one of the extension cables so that the charger can stay in the house and the cable goes out to motorcycle.  I enjoy being able to plug into the bike and then the wall without having to take the panel off to get to the battery.

B000CITKCE,A2MFHJ08ZX3O61,"I got this to maintain the battery on my C63 Mercedes which I (unfortunately) am currently unable to drive and which is just idling under the covered parking next to the house, for months at a time. I connected it directly to ""jump start"" terminals under the hood (the actual battery is in the trunk under the mat - not a very convenient area to access), plugged it into wall outlet on the exterior of our house (the 220V ""utility"" outlet - this device supports it), routed the cable, closed the hood. The indicator light was glowing ""yellow"" (meaning it was charging) and then turned solid ""green"" after a few hours (the charging current of this particular model is small so the process is pretty slow), and I just left it connected after that.Overall I am very satisfied with this unit - it is pretty compact, very inexpensive (especially compared to ridiculously overpriced Mercedes-rebadged CTEK chargers/maintainers), waterproof (I already tested, we had thunderstorm a couple of days ago), fully automatic unit with a good warranty. The only couple of minor drawbacks I can see are that the included cable (the one with alligator clips) is a little bit short (though there's an extension available for extra money, which I already purchased) and that there's no carrying case included. But these are pretty subjective drawbacks and I still highly recommend this unit if you are looking for a truly universal (except for maintaining Li-based batteries), durable battery maintainer.

There was minimal flexing of the rods, the clamps went on securely, and I never felt afraid (LOL!).  I'd heard horror stories from friends who used cheaper spring compressors and I am glad I used these.  You will want a 1/2&#34; ratchet with a longer handle because cranking these down on a heavy spring is some work.  It took me about 45 mins a piece to swap struts.The only reason for knocking down a star was that my springs were too thick to get the retention pin in place and I had to tap the compressors into place because the opening between coils was a little snug.  On lighter springs, this should not be a problem.  I used a pair of hose clamps on each side in lieu of the pins.  It didn't seem necessary since the compressors were rock solid, but the safety was worth the trouble for me.These are good compressors, and I would definitely buy them if I had a regular need.  But, many auto parts stores do free tool loans, and these are the ones that my local store loans out.

But I will never touch that thing again, because for me, it is K&N all the way from here.  I know HD recommends that you use all OEM parts, but K&N is a reputable enough brand for me to trust.  I think that regular and proper maintenance will prolong my engine life far more than just relying on using the OEM parts.  Thats just my 2 cents.

Until using a heat-gun on low heat the glue was not making it into the fine cracks. About thirty seconds after heating on low from the inside of the windshield the cracks totally vanished. Probably a hair dryer will work just as well.Cleaning up the residue from the windshield took some care/effort but the rest of the process was easy",5,Use heat-gun/ hair dryer in winter,1390694400,0,0,Rain-X,"RainX Fix a Windshield Do it Yourself Windshield Repair Kit, for Chips, Cracks, Bulll's-Eyes and Stars",14.54

I lined the blocks up evenly so that even if the vehicle is parked at a slight angle the feel of at least one of the blocks and the blinking stop sign results  in parking the right distance from the garage door without running into objects at the front of the vehicles.The blinking stop signs and these blocks come in at about ten bucks apiece.

First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it...",5,I hope I won't ever need it but still good to know it is there...,1403222400,0,0,NA,NA,50.89

Making my own harnesses for making the unit hard-wired to the battery was a bit time consuming but they turn out well, just FYI don't expect to just bolt it on your standard battery clamp. Its way too small. The cig lighter, if your car has a permanently connected one is probably easier but new cars sometimes control this with key. Oh, two more comments - 1. It doesn't' come with a cig lighter attachment, its optional and 2. the optional hard wire hookup DOES have larger lugs on it)If you are wiring into a motorcycle it might just be long enough, but for my car applications I have always had to make my own harness extensions which is time consuming to get the wires all soldered, shrink wrapped.It does come with a nice little case.Having separate small battery mode and AGM mode is nice, although the paperwork on the basic ones mentioned they would charge AGM.

My experience is based on necessity since the winter fuel here in the northwest is so lousy that all of our vehicles start rough and burn hard. The awful performance is most obvious when you need to suddenly accelerate hard and the vehicle misfires or stutters (it's so lame, and I don't know who to be more upset at - the government or the fuel companies).So I tried a couple of the 5.25 ounce bottles of this Lucas fuel stuff in two or our rigs and the main thing I noticed was that things are smoother, as you'd expect in normal circumstances. Now I bought the gallon version and am refilling these smaller bottles and using it full time (pencils out to be about a buck a treatment doing it this way) and it's been about five tanks. Definitely smoother but not noticing any savings in the miles per gallon department yet. Perhaps on long trips where it's mostly freeway mileage? Don't know and really don't care.

B000GU3KHE,A1PZBHF3YHQXEI,"I have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade, and this is my fourth cover purchase.  They are fantastic quality and fit for the price!Storage indoors, and the cover will easily last 5+ years if you're careful not to snag it, as it will tear easily on sharp corners (mirrors, license-plates, etc.).  For the first 5-6 years of my bike's life, it was stored indoors, and one cover lasted easily during that period... where I live now, I don't have that luxury (yet).Outdoors, this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful UV damage for at least two seasons (mine started to fall apart after 3-years of year-round, outdoor coverage, but I also coat it annually with Camp-Dry to increase water repellent ability and UV protection).  The elastic does start to give out after a couple of years, but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds.Sizing:For sizing, The XL fits perfectly (slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn-signals) over my 1100cc Honda Sabre with 19"" windshield, large saddle-bags, and small tour-pack behind sissy-bar.  This XL fits exactly the same as the XL made 10 years ago, with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals... I'd be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there.If I had to buy again, it would be a toss-up as to the XL or XXL.  My last one was an XXL and it was very loose-fitting, which caused it to flap in the wind, catch wind under it, and sagged in heavy rain, which created places where water would ""pocket"" on top or droop to the seat-level, eventually soaking through the material.  The XXL also covered (almost) all the way to the ground, which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes/engine touching the black material (not the heat-resistant silver).Design Change:The newest version of this cover also does not have silver running 360-degrees around the cover, as in the picture.  The black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel, and the silver starts right behind the forks.  This does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting, and actually looks much better when on the bike.Cons:My only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more ""nylon-feel"" than ""cloth-feel"" of the ones made 10 years ago (or even five years ago), and the cover does not have the full Nelson-Rigg logo... missing ""More than just a Bike"" wording below the logo... no biggie, but having the full logo does make it easier to find the ""front"" of the cover in the dark :)  I do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least, as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months, and still looks like NEW.  We'll have to see about longevity... but if it lasts 2-3 years in outdoor conditions, I'll not be complaining!Update 6-8-14:When putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain, the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors.  The rip was not bad, but very disappointing to spend $40 on a cover that has barely held up to 6-months of use and very mild weather!

I just added another touring bike to my garage, so this will travel with it.

Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.

B000HBM5S2,A2WYCJOJY6QSJI,"First, Permatex makes good products.  This is no different.  There are some products labeled similarly but do not contain true silicone in the same way this product does.This is useful for lubricating all sorts of things.  From moving parts you wish to keep lubricated such as door slides and hinges and other hardware such as that.  It will also help to prevent oxidation (rust) from occurring.  It is also very good for applying to plastic and rubber to both keep them with a film of lubricant which you might want on something such as ""rubber"" weatherstripping on the sides of car windows.  It is also good for for using to keep rubber, vinyl and most plastic parts from drying out.This is a product that goes on wet and while it will dry it will not completely evaporate but leave a protective film of silicone which is a good thing.This is not like products such as penetrating oils like Liquid Wrench or WD-40.  Those are good for their purpose but they are lighter lubricants made for penetrating and not leaving the same sort of film as this silicone spray.There are some items that could also be well lubricated with spray lithium grease but this has the advantage of being clear so it does not remain white so it is nice in that sense.The price here right now is significantly more expensive than the local auto parts store.  I would check prices before purchasing.  I love Amazon and sometimes they have the best price and certainly some of the best customer serviceyou will ever find but you do need to check prices as sometimes prices can be much higher (or lower) from place to place.As an aside, contrary to one persons review, this product is NOT an electrical conductor but just the opposite it is an insulator.It is contained in dielectric grease so do not get it on contacts of electronic products!  It can be used carefully on sockets for electronic connections to be used such as dielectric grease but do not get it on the actual metal contact parts themselves.  I tried to post a link to Wiki about silicone that explains this but Amazon does not allow which is why you see the dots in brackets instead.[...]There are other silicone sprays out there, some are also good, some are not.  Be careful to ensure you get what you are after.That is one thing good about Permatex products, they are a trustworthy company and their products are usually one of the best options for their purposes and they have a huge variety of products for very specific uses, most often in automotive products.  So this is a trustworthy brand that you know what you are getting is as described on the label and you are getting what you pay for.

B000HZA2LA,A32GW1R9MW0XOH,"I had a set of an earlier version of these chains that I used dozens of times in deep snow over many years until the car rusted away.  The hardest part of installation was installing the elastic tensioning device.  The big burly guy in their video makes it look easy but it wasn't so easy for me.  I found that using a skate tightening tool, a metal hook on a plastic handle, made the operation routine instead of a struggle.  Amazon sells an A&R; Lace Tightener which looks like the one I used.To install these cables, after dragging one end from under the car, pull the top inside connecter up and forward to the outside of the tire as much as possible and connect it.  Next connect the top outside connector.  Now push the top inside connector back to the inside of the tire.  Clear the area of anybody with tender ears in case you are prone to verbally expressing your feelings while engaging in frustrating operations.  Now connect the bottom connector.  On solid ground this is sometimes easy.  In snow you may have to keep pulling it back and forth in the back of the tire so it can dig down into the snow and ice until you get enough slack to connect it.  Once this is done it is time to attach the tensioner.  Attach the section where you will have the most leverage last because you will need a lot of leverage to make the last connection.  This is probably the connections at the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions.  Use the lace tightener to help and don't be surprised if you have to remove your gloves for the last connections.  Get both chains on the tires before you do the tensioners so that you can get your frozen fingers back in a warm location as quickly as possible.Removal is the opposite of installation except it isn't hard to disconnect things.For easier connections buy the Peerless Auto Trac chains.  For easier tensioner installation buy the Auto Trac Chains or the expensive Thule chains.  For easier removal buy the Thule chains with the pull release or the Auto Trac chains.Chains are better than cables for traction but the cables have greater tire clearance and possibly better durability and plenty good traction until the snow is deep enough that the bottom of the car is pushing it out of the way and dragging on it.For my next car I first bought Thule chains (soon to be returned) and then Peerless Auto Trac (soon to be delivered) for the greater ease of installation and better traction in deep snow.  I will submit reviews for those after enough time has passed to give a valid review.I give these cable chains five stars for function and durability but an overall rating of four stars due to the difficulty of installation.As other reviewers have noted, do the first installation and the first installation each year in a dry level location to familiarize yourself with the procedure.  Do an installation when they first arrive to make sure they fit your car and to make sure all components are there.  Don't wait because the Amazon automatic easy return policy is only good for 30 days.  You should probably wait until bad weather to order them so that you can try them out while there is still time to return them.",4,Skate Tightening Tool,1389657600,3,3,SCC,"Security Chain Company Super Z6, SZ135, Cable Chain for Passenger Cars, Pickups &amp; SUVs - Set of 2",54.44

If the battery IS put to use, it has to be charged up after every use. Failing to do either of those things will cause the battery to degrade -- and I found that out the hard way.

Like with many subjects, this one is rife with mythology and outright BS. If you cut to the chase, in the vast majority of cases, one thing alone is responsible for killing or shortening the lives of lead acid batteries: sulfation.  There are only two things you can do to keep a lead acid battery from sulfating: 1) always keep it on a charger at 13.6V, which is unrealistic except for emergency only equipment, 2) limit your depth of discharge, 3) periodically rejuvinate and desulfate your batteries.  It's in the last bit that this product has proven handy.  If you put your battery on this machine every now and then, say once a week or so for overnight, you can be sure your battery, no matter the type of lead acid battery, will work better and live longer.I would (have) bought this product and its variants more than once after this initial purchase. I haveAlso know that no product can work a miracle.  If you abuse your batteries, you will kill them and it's not that hard to do.  But with the price of your typical car battery going into the $200 to $500 range these days, the price of maintaining one properly seems less and less.

B000JK2D06,A2MOATGOUSVZ5Y,I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a nice shine on their vehicle and get the most out of the durability of this wax.

B000JK2D06,A2DFINH7PH42RK,"While it might not be the most expensive (nor the cheapest) wax money can buy, it possesses a HUGE bang for the buck.At room temperature, it is kind of like a soft paste - not a liquid, not quite a paste. It obviously changes consistency with temperature. Making sure it is shaken up well is important, as there are more than one chemical at work here. In order to do this, you need to run the bottle under warm/hot water for a little while, to turn the paste into a liquid, and then shake it to get that smooth, thick, liquid consistency we're looking for.Once you get to that point, use it sparingly - I recommend dedicating this wax to a single applicator. I prefer the microfiber applicators from Chemical Guys over the foam applicators you can purchase. This stuff lasts a long time, so if it can lasts months on your car in the elements in a micro thin film, think about how long it's going to last on your applicator pad! It has a pleasant chemical waxxy-like smell. No frills here, it smells exactly like what it is. Hardcore wax.Whatever it is you're waxing, be sure to use a clay bar to ensure a proper, smooth, decontaminated surface. This stuff wipes on super, super smooth, almost like spreading vaseline. It's wonderful to work with, and spreads easily. This means that less is more - I figure since I did a full size car, including wheels, and glass, and yet the bottle looks as if it hasn't even been opened yet, this stuff will last at least 50 full size rigs before you need to worry about purchasing more. And that, is something I like!The nice thing about this is that it isn't one of these off-the-shelf products you can find at &#60;insert superstore/auto parts store here&#62;. If they did, it'd all fly off the shelves and it would be MONTHS before people came back for more. It lasts a long time on the vehicle, so long as the paint is in good shape before you apply it. The cleaner, smoother the paint - the better, longer lasting the shine will be.People rave about this everywhere you go, automotive wise. It's especially popular in fall and winter, because it compliments the rainy season well. It beads water like there's no tomorrow just by itself. And since it isn't one of those products that last about a week until the next wash, it'll keep protecting your paint through the entire season. Spring time will be pretty much pure awesomesauce when you go to give your car that detail you look forward to, and your time is cut in half during the wash process because it'll probably still be working great.Do yourself a favor and learn how to properly wax your car. If you're a nut that just loads the wax on until your car looks like the lady friend coming out of the day spa waring a mud mask? You need a little help.Wax should go on super thin. Using more product than is necessary is simply a waste of product. You should only see a thin, light haze once the product starts to dry. Use little to no pressure when applying, just enough to spread it out over the paint. Work in circles to ensure a good, even coat. Give it 15-20 minutes for the product to 'soak in' and bond with the paint, and dry - it's easier to remove this way, and yields the best result.Some people like to call it quits after you remove the wax, but to really give your paint that 'pop' most people look for (especially pearls & metallic paints), use either a quick detail spray such as Chemical Guys P40 or V07 as a follow up after removing your wax. This not only gives a bit more shine, it also adds another layer of protection that will lengthen the life span of your finish.I would recommend Collinite to anybody looking for a durable, high endurance wax that is easy to apply and practically fool-proof. It is maybe a 7/10 in the 'shine' department, so if you're looking for a top of the line shine, expect to pay top of the line money. But by all means put it over the 845 so when the super spendy stuff wears off, you still have the long lasting protection from Collinite.5 out of 5 stars because it's awesome, and everybody loves it - especially myself, since I'm the one that actually uses it.

B000M5UD1E,A323TKGMGZC2YV,"I recently installed these in my Gen3 Camry, to replace an older set of the same product.  One of the old bulbs had gone out, and since they come in a pair I decided to replace both (keeping the old functional one in a plastic bag in case there is a sudden need).  It has been my experience that these bulbs last satisfactorily long: I checked my receipt, and the last set these replaced were purchased in 2011.  Not only that, but the ones I just bought were roughly half the price!  The great price, brightness, and longevity of these bulbs lead me to giving 5-stars for this product.  I like that they are not yellowy, are legal (most HID replacement kits are not street legal), and do not have that annoying blue/purple hue of HID-imposter halogens.I recommend these for anyone looking to replace their aging or burnt-out low beams.  Remember- halogen bulbs gradually lose brightness over their life, so even if they are still shining, there could be reason to replace them.  That, and DO NOT TOUCH THE GLASS: Certainly not with fingers, better to touch it with nothing at all.

I first purchased one bulb for my 1998 Jeep drivers side and it was far superior to the passenger side so I purchased a second one. Granted the OEM lamps where getting old. I liked the lamp so much I purchased the Silver Star equivilant bulb for my 1983 Honda Goldwing motorcycle. When the OEM bulb went out on my 2004 Subaru Forester there was no question that I would replace both lamps with the Silverstar Ultra. I work at night and live in a mountain community in the Catskills and deer are an issue here. The light is a whiter light then stock halogen lamps. The light seems softer on my eye from the drivers seat and have less glare in the falling snow. Objects and the road seem to almost glow and take on a more distinguished presence. They are more exspensive then the OEM lamps and not rated to last as long as OEM bulbs. In my Jeep the OEM lamps lasted 8 years and the Silver Star where still going strong when the Jeep died 8 years later. So for a few dollars more and a slightly higher cost per mile they are worth every penny. They also seem less annoying to on-coming motorist as commented on by my friends, family and my wife when I pass her at night and asked.

Well, I have been using this for about a month now with anywhere from 40 degrees above to 20 degrees below zero temperatures... and it hasn't failed me once.  It seems to be a good battery... so far.  I do notice that it doesn't like to sit for a couple of weeks before starting your vehicle though... it loses some of it's &#34;umph&#34;.  I am considering the battery tender to make sure it is charged up (my vehicle isn't used every day).  Only time will tell whether this battery is worth the price tag.

I think the Optima battery line is a viable choice when you are in the market for a battery.As for the shipping:  The battery arrived in perfect condition and was well protected by the packaging.

This is good, because in a humid environment, if you stock up the shelf of the garage like I do, small traces of surface rust can form on unprotected threads.  I have one of the U.S.A. ones left, and I'll open this one up to more fully compare gaskets, construction, and measurements between the two. Will update.Note: Avoid the ""PS"" series of K&N.; Inferior quality, not worth the slight price difference.----UPDATE----The center threaded disc that spins onto the post of your vehicle's filter mount has some glue or sealant in the transition between the disc and the rest of the filter's base. I cleaned it off, but am a little disappointed, since the stuff could have come off on its own and circulated through the engine. Maybe it would eventually be caught by the filter, or maybe the particles would just lodge somewhere in the engine.  Not good.

B000OAUAJM,A1U26EX9AE6TUQ,"I purchased these this past Summer when they are at their cheapest, and used them yesterday (1/2/2014). The roads got worse and worse until cars were literally sliding sideways off the road due to ice, and the snow was still falling fast. I found a (relatively) safe place to pull over, in front of another vehicle with headlights on to help me put them on, got back on the road then I navigated the icy hills and curves with no problem at all. Other cars were doing crazy things all around me. I used mine for 11 miles, the last 9 of which were plowed/salted (didn't feel like taking them off). They were on as tight at the end as the beginning. The ride is very bumpy if you're not going over packed ice and snow.Of course when I got them I tried them to make sure they fit OK, which they did. Some listings have more than one application for the same size tire. If your tire size is one of these, this is a clue that you really have to be careful about fit.After using them, rinse with tap water and then lay them out under a lamp to dry. Then spray them with FluidFilm to prevent rust. You can use WD40 to help get them dry, but it will do nothing to prevent rust beyond that.Pro-Tips:1. Order in Spring or Summer for best price.2. Install one in nice weather. Paint the connector segment that corresponds to ideal tension a bright color.3. Put a pair of work gloves in the box with the chains. Disposable heavy duty rubber gloves are best because they have enough feel to do the connections.4. Keep a tarp, or use a floor mat while installing in bad weather. (I keep a small tarp under a floor mat)5. To install easily, put on top of tire and then push all the way over onto the axle. Pull the far side connector back and hook it up, then pull it back over tire and install near side connector.6. I found that 4 (2 sets) of SC1030 will just fit in one box, if you lay them all on top of each other and roll them up together. This may vary by model.Finally, putting on chains in bad weather is a hassle, taking them off once you reach a plowed road is a hassle, and there will always be bad reviews from folks who got the wrong size (for whatever reason). But when the roads are icy and crazy, there's no substitute, not even studded Winter Tires will do as well.",5,Great for ice and snow emergencies,1388707200,5,7,SCC,Security Chain Company SC1018 Radial Chain Cable Traction Tire Chain - Set of 2,23.5

B000PGEMQM,A2SH6A32BE6NEV,"Overall I am happy with this wax because it is easier in the application process.  For one thing, it removes very easily from the surface so you have less need for additional towels, and there is very little in the way of residual leftover that streaks the surface forcing you to go back and wipe down again.  The wax is also not greasy so if you get it on yourself it's no big deal.  Final benefit is that there is no real smell with this, whether it's a powerful chemical or forced artificial smell that nearly all regular waxes have to them. This is a huge factor for me as I apply within my enclosed garage so smells are a big deal.Downside so far is I've noticed it lasting not quite as long as a good carnauba wax.

B000S2QVYE,A1GGNQP11JJRJM,"I recently purchased a 2004 Tahoe Z71 and figured it could use some new wires with all the miles the previous owner racked up. I also purchased these since many other stated that once they took off the original wires, that many of them broke so I wanted to be cautious. The wires had been replaced as they were not stock and some cheap aftermarket brand. These ACDelco wires not only fit better but looked nice and OEM. So far they have performed great and I seem to have a slightly nicer idle, of course the MUCH needed new plugs (another review) I'm sure helped out tremendously. I don't see the need for purchasing anything other than the stock wires and these preform very well and the cost is much less than the &#34;higher quality&#34; aftermarket ones. I highly recommend these stock wires. Don't forget to use dielectric grease on the ends that go onto the spark plugs! I bought a much bigger tube than needed, oh well.

B000SQWVO4,AC6Z7DP1Z5GHD,"I was extremely disappointed in this item. Most of the Camco stuff I have is pretty good, but the problem with this meter is the clear plastic face is not static proof.When comparing with my Fluke multimeter, this meter reads about 2VAC high at 120VAC; or about 1.6% off.When you get the meter, it has a piece of protective plastic over the bezel, and just removing it will induce enough static electricity to cause the pointer to change.  And if you brush across the bezel with your finger, you can make it read anywhere from 110V to 130V, because the static electricity affects the needle.Most meters use a plastic bezel that is immune to static, and does not do this. I don't know if the problem is the plastic the manufacturer used or perhaps they failed to treat it with some chemical.Sadly there are not a lot of options for other brands. I like an analog meter in this case as you can see voltage fluctuations a whole lot better than you can with a digital meter.Hopefully over time this meter will lose it's sensitivity to static electricity.",1,Static electricity affects accuracy.,1401235200,0,0,Camco,Camco 55263 120V AC Line Voltage Meter,14.2

B000UJG0LE,A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,"Almost a decade ago, we belonged to a classic car club. In 2005, when the wonderfully intelligent folks in Washington DC decided to require that gasoline must be cut with ethanol, classic cars starting breaking down like crazy. About the same time I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling in my 2005 Mustang GT. Strange coincidence? Nope...Our mechanics found no problems... they basically told us that Ethanol sucks. To be more exact, Ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of water vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down. This then leads to all sorts of bad things happening inside your engine including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.Ethanol is really just a form of alcohol produced from distilling plant matter, and that alcohol picked up other decades-old particulates in the gas tanks and fuel lines of the classic cars... moving all that old junk to fuel filters and engines, causing them to clog and seize. Alcohol also breaks down plastics and many rubbers, including those used in gas and oil lines & hoses of most lawn equipment and many older vehicles. What a mess.Across the board, our club's mechanics recommended a two pronged attack on Ethanol's detrimental effects: (a) regular use of STA-BIL to remove moisture from the tank & line while stabilizing the Ethanol in the tank to minimize further moisture production; and (b) periodic application of a fuel system cleaner like SeaFoam or BG44K (our choice, which I have used every three or four months since).Our mechanic recommended using the marine version of STA-BIL in our cars, saying that it just seems to work that much better than the regular stuff (but you do pay a bit more for it). Sometimes the marine version is tough to find around here so we use the regular STA-Bil too. Since we have been using STA-BIL to remove moisture and BG44K to clean the system and enhance performance, both my Mustang and our 1930 Ford Model A seem to have run much smoother.Thankfully, the EPA has now recognized that data actually shows ethanol is not as environmentally friendly as ethanol advocates claimed it would be (surprise, surprise... look who made money on that scheme) and the EPA has cut back Ethanol requirements starting 2014. Even if the EPA gets rid of the Ethanol requirement, STA-BIL and BG44K have proven their worth to us and we will continue using them from now on.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try. Totally recommended based on our experiences in the cars we have owned.Go for it.",5,STA-BIL Marine Fuel Stabilizer - 8 oz - Ethanol Fuel Treatment - Works to offset the damage that Ethanol does,1397952000,0,0,NA,NA,11.49

I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.

I cut the cloths in half, they stick perfectly well to our Libman Freedom spray mop.  Better yet, they have so many other uses!Initially I assigned them to various tasks by color code. Yellow were assigned to personal care, green for windows and mirrors and blue for grimier tasks.  Eventually as the cloths become somewhat worn, I cut them in half then they are dedicated to the spray mop.  If I need to use a smaller cloth, I just cut them in half &#34;early&#34; and keep them separate from the floor cloths until they are &#34;worn&#34; a bit and ready to be reassigned to care for our floors. As the final step I use the most worn microfiber cloths for cleaning the toilet, once they've bit the dust they are then discarded. I've already saved more than the cost of these wipes since we no longer use nearly as many paper towels.  They are super easy to rinse out - dirt and grime wash away, fur and hair sometimes need some encouragement to &#34;release&#34; from the microfiber. The cloths do really well in our HE washer.  Since it spins them so thoroughly we just hang to dry and they're ready for their next cleaning task.  Never use fabric softener, it will ruin the &#34;microfiber grabbing power&#34; of the cloths.Did I mention windows and mirrors?  We make a solution of 5 parts white vinegar, 5 parts water and 2 parts alcohol (rubbing alcohol or vodka) to clean our windows and mirrors (it also makes a great all purpose cleaning solution!)

The EZ Cal Cleaner / Descaler and the EZCal Pro liquid didn&#8217;t do wonders in our case either.  So, can't say that we're thrilled with the Air-O-Swiss maintenance products.

B0012ZEZ8A,AQINPIMC09ZAT,"I was excited to get this kit, thought it was a good deal and it was nice I didn't have to select each component separately.  I still think it is a decent value but some of the products aren't great in my opinion and I will be replacing them with others.Clay bar system:This worked great.  Got a good amount of contamination out of/off my paint.  Really made a noticeable difference and I will continue to use it.  Once it is used up I may try a different brand but not because this didn't work well, mostly because I like trying out different stuff to find my favorite.Wash mitt, wax applicator, microfiber towel:These are both fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  I think it would have been nice to include two wax applicators though.  The towel could be larger but overall it is good for wiping the wax off.Car wash:This works well, it is not strong enough to get really stuck stuff off (bird poop for example) but overall it works well.Wax:This is probably the one I like the least.  I don't know why but for some reason it worked very poorly on my black car.  It leaves almost a oil slick appearance (that sort of rainbow look you see with oil in water) to the paint after I use it.  I did used it on my girlfriends car and it worked well on that so I am not sure if it is just a black car thing or what.  It does seem to last decently but after a few weeks the car looses its slick finish and appearance.  I will be switching to something else here for sure, I think I am going to try some Blackfire Wet Diamond based on reviews around the internet.Tire gel:This one is also not very good.  I put it on my tires and they look the same as they did before I put it on.  Waste of time in my opinion.Scratch x and plasti x:I have not had a chance to use these yet.  I might give them a try but I will probably switch to more professional grade detailing products for these tasks.Overall I think the kit is ok for people who want to casually detail their car.  I want to get more serious so I will be switching to more professional grade products overall.  Some of the stuff like the clay bar and the wash are fine and I will use those up before switching.  Other stuff like the wax I will just save and use on my girlfriends or parents cars.",3,"Some good, some decent, some not great, some bad",1396656000,0,0,NA,Meguiar's G55032 Complete Car Care Kit,50.72

Knowing the forecast was for rain I purchased this suit just for the training. Not only did we have rain almost 100% of the time, but the Saturday portion was with 10-25mph winds all afternoon.I'm pleased with the construction, design, and material used for this Rain Suit. Also the size chart turned out to be correct for me. I wear size L to XL. I ordered XL and it is large enough for me to wear over my jeans and a light jacket. Still the pants have sufficient elastic to stay up without a draw string.We were on and off the motorcycles every 15 or 20 minutes. Every time I sat on the motorcycle it was freshly wet from the rain. By the end of the weekend a little water had leaked through in the crotch and my jeans were slightly wet. I'm not sure how that compares with riding 55 mph on the freeway in the rain. Other than that I was perfectly dry.I appreciated the zipper legs which opened the lower pant leg up sufficiently to pull the pants on over my boots.The only annoying thing was the cloth covered bottom part of my helmet kept getting caught on the neck strap Velcro of the suit. I tried several times to adjust the strap so the hook part of the Velcro would be covered but nothing I did prevented the helmet from catching.For the price this is a good suit.

Removed the plastic pinch ""valve"" and put on the above brass, 3/8"" on/off valve.  This valve definitly seals better and may allow more flow as the hose isn't pinched at all anymore.

B0014E3MSS,ALUNVOQRXOZIA,"I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks.",1,CAMCO.  I'd like to start a business to compete with them.

No problems with the lid staying tight on mine.I was asked why not just recycle using the 5-qt jug the oil came in? I do, but that's not enough. First of all I sometimes recyle ATF that comes only in 1qt bottles. Refilling those is a pain! Second I usually have 1 quart left over in the 5-qt oil jugs. I can combine these, once I have two, but then... I need to keep at least one of these available to measure removed ATF, since checking ATF levels are not trivial on most modern vehicles (warm-up, cycle through gears, etc.) Third, lawn mowers are filled from a jug but use only a quart or two, so that used oil has to go somewhere. It might be 3 seasons of mowing before the source jug becomes available.Pro tip: Build a 2x4 stand with a big funnel on top and a clamp above that. Put this jug on the base, clip your drain pan above the funnel and leave your oil bottle and filter inside the funnel and let it all drain for a day or two. That way you'll keep oil out of the dump and throw away cleaner empties.

Using this to remove some pretty tight ball joints that a pickle fork and some serious persuasion with a sledge hammer would not budge, this did get the job done.  However, there's a steel ball in a recess on the end of the bolt to allow the bolt to turn while you crank it down.  I put a pretty good flat spot on that ball the first time I used it.  It still works, but not quite as smoothly as when new.  There was an incredible amount of force being applied to flatten about 1/4 of a ~quarter inch steel ball, and the tool didn't break, so I guess this is alright.  Either way, this worked on my '95 BMW 740i lower control arms, where a pickle fork couldn't get a good bite and where there was no room to directly hammer on the ball joint, so I'm happy with it.  I've used it on all of my subsequent jobs, and it hasn't broken yet.Probably the main thing I'd like to see improved upon would be the use of a flanged bolt head so a wrench (like a Gear Wrench) could be easily used without slipping up the head onto the threaded area.

The rest are geared for other purposes and the others they allege for cleaning glass (not the right type of microfiber for the job).  They are also way too tight a fit around the triangular head which causes it to bow, so unless you apply enough pressure you will have an unevenly smeared, sloppy cleaned surface.This is a good concept, but marketed with too much hype.

Neither car had ever had the headlights restored or polished in any way prior to using this, so I would imagine most people can get two full cars out of one kit. Some tricks and tips:1) Use a corded drill. Even the cheapest corded drill from the hardware store should run at 1600 rpm.2) Go slow. Let the sandpaper and the rotation do all the work. The harder you press, the more likely you are to bind the sandpaper.3) Clean the sandpapers and wet grinding pads frequently. Plastic tends to ball up and gum up the grinding medium. Wipe it off with your hand or a towel every pass or two.4) Follow the included instructions exactly. Don't skip steps or try to use one paper for too long.The end result is a perfectly clear headlight which outputs far more light than before.

I was told by others to use water on all the sandpaper gritt to make it last longer.  I totaly agree with them.  Just use a spray bottle and start sanding away.

B001AIZ5HY,A1VS1LL905P5L5,"Oil, filter and tire changes are taken for granted as periodic maintenance necessities. Others, as wiper blade replacement, are more often neglected until their declining function forces attention. But your dimming headlights are such a gradual process that it's easy to go completely unaddressed though degraded lighting poses a real safety threat. The clear plastic covering the headlights is exposed to chemicals splashed up from the road surface and acid rain which is constantly baked on by the intense heat of modern bulbs. Oxidation happens until it looks like it's wrapped in wax paper and your headlight beams are severely compromised. This kit and 20 to 30 minutes of your time can render those lenses crystal clear and looking like new.  The instructions note that you will need to have access to an electric or battery powered drill.  The kit comes with a disc pad holder that fits into the drill. Small circular sandpaper discs are attached to the pad via a velcro-like backing. There are supplied several discs of 500 grit, 800 grit, a ""trizak"" disc for further polishing, a foam pad and and a small amount of polish/rubbing compound cream.  Before beginning work, the area around the headlight needs to be protected with recommended masking tape. 3M Kits I'd purchased in the past included this tape, but this particular kit does not.  (Kit #39014 also sold on Amazon includes 25' of tape but costs about $7 more. If you already have suitable masking tape from a painting project you can save a few dollars with this kit though.)  I used blue masking tape found in big box home supply stores in the painting section.  Two layers are recommended to assure no damage happens to the adjacent car body paint surrounding your headlights.  Once taped, the lens should be washed with soap and water to remove any dirt. Attach the first disc and with light to medium pressure go over the entire lens, making certain not to stay in one spot too long which would heat and damage the plastic. You might feel some uncertainty and wonder if you're destroying your lenses because they become a milky white. Be certain to periodically pat the disc to remove any residue dust buildup. When you have a consistent surface, move on to the next finer grit, the white 800 disc. This refines the surface though still an opaque white. The lens should be wet with a spray bottle or damp cloth and kept wet while using the Trizak disc. Finally use the foam pad attachment with dime sized amounts of the polishing cream. It's best to put the cream at the center of the disc and then slide it around the lens before you turn on the drill to have an even distribution and less spatter.  If you don't rush through the process and do each step completely, you should now have headlights that look completely new. I've used perhaps 5 of these kits over time and the results are consistently amazing. There are kits that are easier to use with only fluids you apply by hand and elbow grease. They work ok, depending on the degree of residue and oxidation you have to remove. But if you want a professional looking restoration and you have a little patience, this kit provides outstanding results. Just be certain to purchase the necessary masking tape and try not to rush through the process.",5,The most effective kit I've used to clarify cloudy headlights,1399939200,1,1,3M,3M 39008 Headlight Lens Restoration System,14.56

I have used them on dozens of headlights and vehicles over the years and without fail, they produce excellent results that look good as new from about a foot or more every time and substantially increase headlamp output.The key with this system is using a corded drill (I seriously doubt any battery operated drill could even handle one headlight with the amount of time this takes) and being very, very patient. The instructions repeatedly remind the user that time spent on each individual step will reduce time needed at the next step. What they mean to say is, &#34;When you think you might be done, keep sanding. Then when you really think you're done, keep sanding more.&#34;Make sure you tape off (two layers at least) the painted parts of your vehicle that you do not want damaged by rotating sandpaper.There are usually enough supplies in the kit to do 2-6 headlights.",5,This is probably my 10th one.

B001AIZ5HY,A2Q6A2CYJERF5O,"Great kit. It took me about 90 minutes per headlight. I took mine out of the car to make it easier. It was very easy on my e39 BMW. They look like new now. You just have to be patient and use light pressure only. And I did it all wet sanding. I don't think the directions stated that you should use wet sanding. That's very important. Otherwise you'll melt the plastic if you're not careful. It also sands much much faster and you use fewer sanding discs.Afterwards, I used the Blue Magic 730-6 Headlight Lens Sealer to hopefully protect the lens a little bit. It did seem to help. Water beads up very nicely on the lens now and ice doesn't stick to it so solidly. I'm happy with my purchase.Also, note that not all headlight lenses are made the same. My BMW has a very hard polycarbonate lens. After 14 years, it was only slightly aged. It took a LOT more sanding than on my parents 10 and 8 year old VW Jettas. My BMW had some kind of really hard coating on the lens that needed to be sanded through. Then it polished up much quicker.I used a 12v Milwaukee cordless mini drill on my lenses. The small size was very convenient and my two batteries worked fine for my headlights. In the case of polishing, more power is not always better.",5,Nice kit.

Also easy to reset, and so get daily energy production.Cons:- Smallish screen with no backlight. No reading this thing from a distance- No way of getting data out. Strongly recommend that manufacturer adds pin-outs or USB plug to enable external data. Bluetooth would make this device magic.I saw some questions about how to get this to work with a solar panel/battery system. According to the instructions and my experience: Connect the black wire of the &#34;source&#34; side (the side with the pins) to the negative terminal of the charge controller. Connect the black wire on the non-&#34;source&#34; side to the negative terminal of the battery. Connect the positive terminal of the charge controller to the positive terminal of the battery (like normal). Connect the red wire of the &#34;source&#34; side to the positive terminal of either the charge controller or the battery - this wire can be thin since it is only measuring voltage, not conducting power, and if you add an in-line switch to it then you can easily reset the Watts Up measurements by briefly turning the switch off.

B001BNZGY0,A2OB0IK83HTU18,"I've tried this on a couple of items and will update my review accordingly.1. 10 Year Old Camshafts (found in the Back of my garage) - rusted and oilyResults: Submerged for 24 hours and most of the rust and all of oil was gone. I took a Scotch Brite pad to the remaining rust and it came right off.2. Battery Corrosion in Flashlight (three AAA batteries were in a flashlight in my car for two years)Results: I soaked the corroded battery holder (the plastic piece that held the three AAA batteries inside the battery case) for two days and most of the corrosion was gone. This was after I tried using baking soda. A quick hit with a tooth brush sealed the deal. The metal contacts are not perfect, but clean enough that I can use the mini-flashlight after it went unused for at least years! The corrosion inside the aluminum flashlight was fixed with baking soda, but if it was any worse I would have soaked the corroded portion in the solution.Overall, this is a good non-toxic product. The are faster alternatives, but it's safe, reusable and can last for years if you keep it sealed.Next on the testing block will be an old rusted pressure plate from my Nissan Silvia clutch and a bunch of rusted bolts.To be continued....4/14 Update:I filled two Quart containers with oily, rusted bolts that I found around the garage and added Evapo-Rust. After one day, the bolts looked a little better, but nothing amazing. Day two looked better. On day three, you could see a layer of crud building up at the bottom of the containers. I decided this was long enough, so I dumped them in the sink and grabbed a clean rag.The remains of the rust wiped right off most bolts. The rust that was REALLY invasive, didn't come completely off, but I have no doubt another few days would have done it.While you can recycle Evapo-Rust, it was so dirty from the oil and rust remains, I decided to get rid of the used portion. Overall, 98% of the bolts look like new (in addition to a few rusted nut driver bits that I threw in for good measure) so I can't complain. If you are in a rush, you may want to try something else, but I like what I've seen so far.In terms of the chemicals, there was little to no skin irritation on my hands, so that's a big plus!",4,Slow and Effective,1396742400,2,2,Evapo-Rust,Evapo-Rust ER004 Rust Remover 32 oz,10.4

They are made of thick guage steel, painted semi-gloss black, and fit perfectly using existing screws at the lower corners of your windshield.  There was other review(s) concerning protecting paint under the brackets in case you want to remove them later.  I found two solutions.  Either lay the mounts on some old pieces cut from an inner tube, or I used the rubber backing from an electrical wall cover box that I had in my workshop.  Just traced around the mount, cut the material to match and punched a couple of holes (with a paper punch) for the screws-problem solved.  I like how low and out of your way these mounts put your lights.  I mounted two Rupse 2x2 27W Square LED Work Lights (from Amazon) 1600lms and installed a lighted rocker switch in my dash.

The locking chuck on my previous purchases would clip on and stay locked on tight to my tire valve.  The ones here do not stay locked on.  The second I let go of pushing it on the valve, the pressure drops to zero.  I contacted the manufacturef on the package - GH Meiser - and they were so kind as to send me replacement chucks but these were only marginally better.  But when I tried inflating my tire thru this gauge, the gauge reading would swing all the way past 100 as the compressor was pumping air.  This is not the way my previous years' purchases behaved.  If the recommended pressure was 35, my old Accugauges would read around 40-ish as the compressor was running....not swing wildly to 100 as this one does.

It absorbs the shampoo water great and diffuses it to the car.- The removable cloth gives the advantage of easy cleaning.- 48"" extension pole (fixed length) is adequate for reaching every spot on a sedan size car. (I am not a tall person).-The head and pole parts are articulated with a hinge so can move freely adjusting the shape of your car.Cons:-Although not very often, every now and then the removable cap falls off during operation. You need to secure it tightly using the adjuster string and it is not the simplest thing in the world.My conclusion:So far it looks as a durable and well performing item.

You do need to wash and thoroughly clean the car before using this.  The bottle says this, but they should highlight it a bit more; you don't wanna use this if there is any grit on the car at all, or you may scratch the paint.Anyway, the directions read like a normal wax; apply, wax on, turn over the towel, then wax off.  But in practice, this wasn't required; rather, after spraying on, it only needed to be waxed on; the same microfiber towel seemed to simply polish it right in (like the paint was absorbing it).  I didn't have to turn the towel over.  Maybe I wasn't using enough, but it seemed to work; definitely improved the shine.  I've yet to see how water &#34;phobic&#34; it is, as it hasn't rained yet, but I'm hoping it will be very much so.The only downside to this product vs other types of wax, is that the nature of being a wide spray nozzle means some of it is going to go places you don't intend it to... like on glass...  the windshield, lights, plastic parts, your clothes, etc.  So, just be careful with it.

B001O7PNW8,A3DV41BS0CMIW6,"I purchased this after reading rave reviews in several different forums and websites. The reviewers were right. This product does exactly what it is intended to do. It's perfect for compounding a vehicle in need of paint correction. If you have swirls and light scratches, then this is what you use if you want to eliminate them. For those that use off the shelf waxes at the auto store (as I used to do), they only temporarily cover up the swirls, they do not remove them. I spent close to 30 hours researching how to properly do paint correction and this was one of the most hyped compounding polishes out there from the pros.I started by using a clay bar and clay lubricant on my car to remove the contaminants in the clear coat that even the M105 won't pull out. Then after washing the car, I used a Porter Cable DA polisher (also purchased here on Amazon) to compound the car's surface with the appropriate pad (typically orange). I worked in 2 foot by 2 foot sections and used cross hatch patterns to assure even coverage. This really brought out a lot of shine and this isn't even the polishing stage yet! It wouldn't pull out one heavier scratch that I have, but it made quick work of the smaller scratches and completely removed the swirl marks. Keep in mind that this is an abrasive. You don't want to use this every time you detail your car because it removes a very small amount of the clear coat. You should hopefully only have to use this once to correct the issues then you can maintain the paint from there.I then used Meguiar's M205 to polish the car, again using the DA but this time with a white pad designed for polishing This is what brings out the shine! It's like wood working.. you start with a rougher 120 grit to get the majority of the roughness out, then move up to a less aggressive 240 grit sandpaper to smooth it out even more.

I washed, used a clay bar, then did a proper 2-step polishing process using Chemical Guys Hex-Logic Orange, then White polishing pads on a Porter Cable 7424 XP.After buffing to remove, I went over it with a coat of V07 Spray Sealant.  First impressions were that this wax was a good product.  It applied evenly,  dried to a haze in a reasonable time, and removal wasn't too much work.  The wax produced a nice shine, although this is irrelevant because wax only protects shine that is created from buffing.  Many people don't realize this, as wax creates the appearance of a shine by filling imperfections in the paint, but a true shine is created from buffing.I have washed the car twice since application - both times with Chemical Guys Maxi Suds car wash. Much to my disappointment, the quality of water beading after the 2nd wash significantly diminished which indicates that the wax layer is degrading.  It is still there, and I know a little V07 will bring it back to life, but overall lifespan was not as good as it should be.This isn't a bad product, so I chose 3 stars because it is reasonably priced, easy to apply/remove, but lifespan is not up to snuff.

B001TI1F5Q,A2DFINH7PH42RK,"So admittedly, I didn't purchase this on Amazon - but since I'm on Amazon so much, I figured I may as well review it here as well.First of all, this stuff smells amazeballs. And it continues to have a very light scent for a couple of days after applying before it wears off. It smells like New Car Scent - which is pleasing to 99% of people.As for it's sheen, it goes on a thin liquid, and a little goes a long ways. Less, is more - like with more Chemical Guys products. I gave a microfiber applicator a couple of sprits, and went to down on the interior of one of our vehicles and instantly fell in love. It's a good half-way point between a gloss dressing, and a flat dressing (Such as InnerClean or Vintage Natural Shine).I'm not a big gloss fan, the interiors of cars aren't glossy from the factory, and in my belief - they should never BE glossy. But a litlte silky smooth/satin like sheen is good, it brings out the color of the interior. It really brings it to life.I used this on a black interior as well as a beige interior, and was satisfied with both. This product doesn't remain greasy whatsoever, and really soaks down into the pores. The black became black again, without that sun-faded gray color that most black interiors take on after a few years. After applying, I just give it a quick rub-down with a dry, clean microfiber towel to remove the excess, which takes a tad bit of gloss away (which I like) without removing all the material. Once it dries, it's dry - feels just like the dash should be, only it looks great.For the price of this product, it's worth a shot even if you've never used a professional product line. In the end if you don't like the results, give it to somebody else and let them try it.I believe this stuff would work great on the exterior as well, but I like to use dedicated exterior dressings because a water based dressing will generally be short-lived in wet, damp, and humid climates. Oil based dressings, when used correctly, last a lot longer and give good results.I highly recommend all Chemical Guys products, their quality is top notch and I have been satisfied with every product I've used so far.Enjoy.EDIT:So I went outside and gave the car a good cleaning since the weather is nice this weekend. Well, I decided to do the engine bay as well. After a good clean & dry, I decided to try this product out in the engine bay. Now, I'm not much for dressings in the engine bay because products tend to turn rubber and silicone pieces brown/yellow, which can be a pain to remove and is quite the eye-sore. While I can't comment on whether this does that, too - I will say this is the EASIEST dressing I have ever used under-hood. Gives a really good depth to black plastic pieces, and really gave the engine bay the 'pop' that most people go for. While I likely won't do this again (personal taste), I did want to give this product a shot and a thorough review. This product dries, and is very thin - therefore it made a great candidate for a dust-ridden environment such as an engine bay. It gave everything a good bit of protection, and even did a good job on clear plastics, making them seem semi-transparent (Washer Fluid bottle, overflow tank specifically). Just make sure everything is clean first, or like in my other dressing reviews - you're going to make really pretty mud.Very impressed!",5,Fell in love with this stuff!,1394236800,1,1,Chemical Guys,Chemical Guys TVD_109_16 - Silk Shine Sprayable Dressing (16 oz),9.95

The scent is citrus, with a leaning towards lemon. So if you've ever used a lemon scented cleaner, this is about what it smells like, only more fresh.It does a great job removing dirt, stains, and cleaning agents from Microfibers, and it leaves them coming out of the dryer nice and soft, plush, and not laden with product.I would certainly use a little extra on heavily soiled loads, just because. I bought the 16oz bottle first, but I just recently purchased a gallon jug because this stuff goes quick if you wash a lot of microfibers. I use this on my pads and applicators as well.Just remember if you are using waxes and sealants, that they are designed to be rugged and durable on a car. The same applies to your applicators and towels! I like to pre-soak these items in a little bucket with a mixture of a cap full of this, and a shot of Chemical Guys' lightning fast stain extractor in hot water. This breaks down the grease a little better, and you can drain the bucket (which is full of nasties) and then wash them in the washing machine.I also only use hot water when washing, cold washing doesn't work all that great. I run a 15 minute cycle, stop it at 10 and let it soak for 10 minutes, and then continue the wash. Rinses everything out, every time.Highly recommended, this actually works.

I also am using an old sheet to cover the bike first as I was getting a film on the bike. The film may be condensation forming then drying. I will post back if the sheet cover is practical and if it works. The only reason I did not give it a five star is that it is a tight fit on my Harley Dyna because I have a windshield and a medium height sissy bar so the cover doesn't go all the way to the ground and protect the entire wheel. It also moves the mirrors out of adjustment it is so tight. If you don't have a windshield or a sissy bar I am sure it would be a perfect fit. Actually if you look at the picture it covers a little better than illustrated so  maybe I am being a bit too critical but I would like it to cover the entire wheel.

B0024ECHII,AX1NJKXIERL1X,"As others have noted, you need to buy the nuts and bolts to install this.  It also wants a nice flat area to install - about 1-1/2' x 8'.  My steps aren't flat - but have some built in ridges for water drainage.  My step also has a cross member for strength (or lifting), but certainly limited my choices of locations.  One screw location conflicts with the support itself  in the &#34;up&#34; position (near the retainer clip) - so you either need an exactly correct length bolt so the leg can swing back into the storage spot, or drill two holes (one to either side that will stay clear of the leg).  I had it, so I found a way to install it with some shims and it seems to be stable.  As others have mentioned, it might be better to overdrill the factory 3/16&#34; holes and use larger bolts.  The leg doesn't lock in the down position, so it seem that it may slowly swing out of position over time when in use.  I purchased just one and mounted it to one side of the stair - when my door is open you are sort of pushed to use just one side of the stairs anyhow.

B0024ECHII,A3CZBEJLN5CQK0,"I'm not sure if the supplier is reading the reviews or not but I read that the hardware to mount this was not included. That issue must have been heard, because my steps (I ordered 2) came with screws, lock washers, and nuts to mount them to the step. I had it installed in about 5 minutes after I found a fresh battery for my drill.A few notes:The good:- Once installed, they are really sturdy and made a big difference in the feel of the step and reduced the motion in the camper when we were climbing in and out.-Like I noted above, the hardware is included to mount and install.-The legs are adjustable and do in fact store out of the way once you adjust the retention springs.The bad:-The retention spring on both of my steps needed adjustment out of the box. It isn't a big deal, but is a nuisance. I used a set of locking pliers and reshaped the spring to provide a secure hold on the legs for travel. Having said that, I'm still worried that it will come loose on the road and cause some damage. I think I may throw a zip tie on it before I move the camper. I always have a pack on hand so it isn't a big deal.-The material looks like it will rust very fast.

Bug and Smudge spray is used as a pre-treatment to remove bug residue, rubber marks and general road grime.  It is sprayed on and it softens the substance for easier removal by washing.  Equally important as being effective, it is safe.  Griot's Garage products are among the few brands that I trust completely when it comes to cleaners.  Some over the counter brands sold in auto part stores can be too harsh or even caustic in some cases (e.g. some brands of wheel cleaners).  I always trust Griot's Garage products and use nearly every form of cleaner and dressing that they sell.  The only downside is that they are on the expensive side.",5,Great Like All Griot's Garage Products,1400112000,0,0,Griot&#39;s Garage,Griot's Garage 11088 Paint Sealant - 16 oz.,19.99

All you do is spray, let it fit a few minutes then wipe off.  I avoid hitting non flying items, so I can't comment how it works on smudge marks.However, tar was not as easy to remove.  Maybe Griot's is not made to remove tar since it states it removes &#34;bug and smudges&#34;.  This was a bit of a disappointment since my BMW Roadster Convertible sits really low to the ground and the front end picks up everything from the road, especially the new tar being laid in the early Spring.

Over the years I have owned many mitts, sponges, and other accessories, made of many different materials that are supposed to help me get my vehicle clean.  The Zwipes wash mitt is the best thus far.  Far better than any microfiber cloth I have used.  It picks the dirt out of the nooks and crannies as well as the flat surfaces. The true test was on the bike.  Motorcycles, while I love them, are a pain to clean.  There are so many little places.  After using the this mitt I barely had any small areas to get at with a small cloth with something tiny stuck in it to put pressure in the little space to clean it.  Other than dirt on the mitt, I have no fear of it scratching the paint.My better half has used the other mitt around the house for dusting and other such cleaning chores, she loves it!They clean up nicely as well.These are worth every penny of the nearly $15 bucks they cost.

The mitts have long microfiber fingers that increase surface area to retain moisture and suds while aiding in washing.  They slip on easily and have an elastic band at the wrist to help keep them on your hands.  You get two mitts for the price paid, so you can either wash with both hands for faster car washing or use the other mitt to dry your car (I found it works better than a chamois).  When they get dirty you can toss them in the laundry to get them clean as new.There is absolutely nothing to dislike about these mitts.

It's not easy finding the right wash accessories to get the job done quickly and correctly. And given the dark color, I'm quite cautious when it comes to using the right stuff. Well, I gave it a good test this past weekend when I was cleaning off 2 weeks of rain, dirt, and grime.The big concern is that with a very dirty vehicle, washing by hand can basically move dirt around on the paint. Obviously this can have a very negative effect on the pain. This is why touch washes can be so bad. Not to mention the possibility of getting the previous vehicles dirt. It's important that the wash mitt is able to pull the dirt away while washing. With this design, it looks like that is accomplished.Personally, I prefer to go through a basic touch-less wash if the vehicle is dirty, as a first step. The high pressure soap/water will remove the big scratch-prone dirt. Then go home and do the rest by hand. Rise, wash with soap, water, and the mitt. Use a gritt guard in your bucket so you can run the mitt across each time to help ensure large dirt is removed. Rinse, dry, and enjoy.The truck looked great. No scratches or scuffs. The soft wash mitt's design also allowed it to get into the little crevices such as the grill and badge to get it clean. Still looks shiny.

When I started researching whether to stick with Prest-O-Fit or try something different this time, I began noticing the RhinoFLEX systems in use by other RV'ers.  I took a closer look at the RhinoFLEX and really liked the tough construction, the locking swivel fittings, the dark hose color (won't show dirt as much), and especially the way the hose accordions and stays put like a bendable drinking straw... something my old Prest-O-Fit hose didn't do.

The clear piece that you purchase separately is a wonderful addition since you can easily see that your tank is clean, through the clear fitting. Since the dump station we used was close by, we only had to use one part of the 10' hose, allowing us to keep the other as a spare, or in the event we need to use a longer hose at a hook-up site.

My previous jack was a craftsman  2-1/4 ton Floor Jack and using the OTC jack was a world of difference. The OTC jack had no trouble lifting up my cars whole front end, which really made it efficient by being able to place two jack stands on either side at once rather than jacking up one side at a time (it really is a big convenience).This jack is very light compared to others 2-ton jacks and I love the dual piston feature this has. The pumping action is indeed quick. The jack stands are also a delight. Very light, strong, and no bickering when putting the pin through the hole to set the height of the jack stand. The jack handle is a two-piece design and snaps togetherI've had the OTC jack for a little over two years and the jack failed on me while I was using it back in 6/13 (almost a year ago). I was working on my brothers car, on the brakes, jacked up the whole front, placed the jack stands, and that is when the jack began to fail. the Jack didn't make any noise to indicate the failure. What happened was the oil just started to leak out in fast amounts. I had to use my craftsman jack to take off the jackstands.I contacted OTC shortly after, and although I can't exactly remember what happened, the overall process was hassle-free and OTC ended up replacing my whole jack! I was very surprised they OTC didn't try to put the blame on me or whatnot. I did, however, send them pictures of the jack failing, the oil, etc (I'll post the same pictures up here, too).Since then, the jack has been very solid and still use it with confidence (of course, I am still using the jack stands, but this practice should be done with any and every hydraulic jack).

The mirrors have a snug adjustment, but that's a good thing becuase they don't bounce around very much while going down the road.  Some towing mirrors really vibrate while you're traveling and that can be pretty annoying after awhile.There are 4 peices to each mirror.  The mirror itself, the wedge bar to hold the mirror in place, and the bolt that applies pressure to the wedge to make sure the mirror doesn't move while driving down the road.  There's also a peice of stick on felt for the wedge bar so it doesn't rub your mirror.I had 2 problems with the design.1) The set srew that you turn to apply presure and hold the mirror in place was fine on the one mirror, but on the other mirror there was some much resistance when turning it that I thought I was going to snap the turn handle off.  After several slow attempts with some WD40 applied, it finally turned all the way in.  After a couple of installations the bolt has loosened a little and seems to be fine now.2) Wedge bar felt strip requires trimming, so it isn't cut to fit out of the box.  While this is a minor thing, it's still kind of a pain.  The other problem is that the wedge bar is loose when the mirrors aren't in use, so if you aren't careful you could loose the wedge and then the mirror would be useless.  The bolts stay in just fine due to friction, but I don't like having loose unattached peices on something like this becasue it never fails that at some point one of them will go missing and will probably happen while on the road.Overall these mirrors work well, I just wish they were designed a little differently.",4,"Did the job, but the products not perfect",1403654400,0,0,CIPA,CIPA 11300 Toyota Tundra Custom Towing Mirrors - Sold as Pair,58.74

Well this past fall I blew the lines good with air and my good air compressor to the right pressure no to over do what the lines can hold and long and a few times.Well with the super cold winter we had I got nervous after a few super cold days in Dec and figured I would pump rv antifreeze through all the lines which I have always done just in case my fears were right.

I warmed up coach for a few hours and used a few space heaters till lines became unfrozen.

B002ZBWKDC,A198CCH4NNLI2E,"I got a small construction staple stuck in my tire. Right on the tread, a few very small holes. Exactly what this product is designed for. I followed the directions to a 'T', the Slime &#34;clotted&#34; in the hole and stopped the leak, and then I drove a few miles slowly to get the stuff well distributed in the tire. I measured the pressure over a few hours and it held. The next day, however, I drove to work and when I came back to my car that evening, the tire was flat. Lost pressure faster than when I had the staple in! It's been extremely cold here (Boston in February) and we've got a lot of snow, so my guess is that this stuff doesn't work too well in those conditions.I know a lot of people seem to have good luck with this, but I figured it would be useful to temper things a bit with the perspective of somebody for whom this product didn't work at all. Most importantly, watch out when using this in very cold weather.One more thing: if you look at the reviews you'll see that's it's pretty much either 5 stars (worked for people) or 1 star (didn't at all) with not much in between. It appears to work for about 3 out of 4 people, resulting in a pretty high average review (hence the four star overall rating). And that's assuming the Slime people are uncommonly honest and don't post false positive reviews.Put another way, THERE IS AT LEAST a 25% CHANCE THIS PRODUCT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR YOU! A 25% chance this will cause you far more trouble than if you'd just had the tire patched or used a more conventional tire sealnt, and that will make you deeply regret buying this. I'd actually say that for a product like this a 25% chance of failure is WAY too high. So, consider the 4/5 star review in that context. 4/5 might be a good rating for a TV, but for a product that is fixing something as important to your safety as a car tire, having a 3:1 ratio of five to one star reviews actually isn't that great.",1,Works great...

I installed it like indicated and plugged it into my trailer wiring plug. When I tested the lights the turn signal activated the wrong side, so I had to remove the light bar and reinstall it in the opposite direction.

LOLOLThe valve lock is great and makes filling anything so much more comfortable than trying to press on a traditional air chuck and hear the hissing when you do not get it just right and end up dumping more air than you put in.The steel braided fill hose that swivels makes it so nice just turn the hose and the pressure gauge is always towards you.The large fill lever is easily operated with just one finger.The bleeder is excellent for dumping over filled air in small amounts instead of pushing the valve stem and then having to go back and forth with pressure gauge and something to bleed the air thru the valve stem and back again.Pressure gauge size makes for easy reading of pressure, and being clipped onto the valve stem, and the one handed design is exceptional.With the air hose fitting already installed you just plug it into your air line and start pumping.  No running to the store to buy a fitting.The PSI and Kpa marks, to me are backwards, should be PSI on the outside of the gauge and KPA inside, but no biggie.PSI is not well marked but easy enough to read.

Few of the mechanical one's did not work well in extreme cold weather, also hard to use with gloves on and too cold to use with bare hands.  Few others had issues with sealing the valve so it would not read accurately.  Some of the other digital brands did not seal the valve, or the battery would die quickly (like every week), or it was reading inaccurately.  I've been researching for the past few weeks on Amazon and this was the only one with great praise so i decided to try it out.  As soon as i got it i ran out and compared it to a mechanical one which I have been using with frustration and also a friend of mines gauge (Commercial grade digital gauge) and low and behold this one read accurately to 35 lbs, w/o issues and the mechanical one I had took me about a minute to get a correct seal to get a reading and then it read 3lbs too high, 5 lbs too low, etc. Compared to the commercial grade gauge.

It does it's job REALLY well and it should not be rated low because of it.This dash grip is VERY sticky; I have never had anything fall off of it, which is what you are looking for. I have had other grips before and they are all worthless. We put this one in my wife's car because she has a Hello-Kitty bobble head, and we just did not know how to put it on the dash without it falling off or being too strong and damaging the dash. This is the key. We can put our phones on it while the bobble head still sits on the dash, and nothing has ever fallen off.I would say though, that this is very sticky. The bobble head has been on the grip pad for several months and it has gotten more and more stuck to the pad.

Yes, the extendable handle could be longer, but I also have another type of SUV brush that can handle that task.  This brush is perfect if you drive a small to intermediate size vehicle like a Corolla, Civic, Sentra or Elantra.I bought mine off of Amazon without realizing they sold these at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond and could have gotten it cheaper with the use of a 20% coupon.  Then again, I have an aversion to shopping in malls and stores so the price was fair and worth it.  I imagine it will hold up just fine, but I imagine it might be a challenge to remove heavier, wet snow.  An alternative brush with stiffer bristles like the other one I have may work better.  Construction appears to be solid and built well.EDIT 2/4/14:  Tried using it on more wet, heavier snow today after a snow storm dumped 4 inches.  As anticipated, the wetter snow caused the bristles to become heavy and clogged a bit.  If you are going to store it in your car after removing this type of snow, it will cause quite a wet mess.  Bang off or brush against your car tire to minimize the melt off.  The brush still did its job, but once the bristles are heavy and wet it starts to get a bit more challenging.

B003IS3HV0,A33FG1YPBIIW5X,"I've been trying for years now to find the right product to really bring the luster back to leather seats that are in pretty good condition and make them look like they had just been stitched on. I've tried many products, all with varying degrees of success. Prior to Leather Honey, I had a product which seemed to work well and really give the leather a supple feel, but it just didn't last. It was as if the conditioner was visual only and did nothing to actually nourish the seats. This became frustrating rather quickly, as I didn't enjoy constantly reapplying it and the greasy feeling it left behind. Aside from that, there were many other very well known leather care products I used with next to zero positive return on my investment.So... I happened to come across Leather Honey and decided to give it a shot. All the reviews were great and it sounded promising, so I figured it couldn't hurt. The very second this stuff touched my seat- literally the very moment it touched- the leather soaked it up and felt softer and looked much better. I continued to spread it across the seat and it just kept getting soaked in and I could feel the leather changing under the cloth. I applied quite a heavy amount because I didn't think it would take as fast as it did. So I am now anxiously awaiting to see how it looks after I let it sit for over 24 hours. 12 hours in, the leather is completely transformed. The car I'm using this on came factory with very high end leather, but I don't think it's possible that it has ever looked as good as it does now.The cracks have soaked in the most, so I am reapplying as needed, and it just looks incredible. Words really don't do this product justice, and I don't think pictures show enough detail to really give one an idea of just how rich this stuff is. It doesn't look, feel, smell, or apply like any other leather product I've seen, and that's good- it tells me that whatever it is used in this product is doing its job well. Do yourself the favor of not buying the smaller bottle. I can promise you that you will instantly want more, as you're going to be applying it to every single thing you own which contains leather once you see the results. Don't believe me? Buy it and see for yourself.

B003N9AT5G,AZD412AH3W49I,"I was away on business during a huge ice storm throughout the Philadelphia suburban region.  My wife called and told me that we had no power... along with about 700k other people.  After reading several reviews, I ordered this WEN 3500W generator via Amazon Prime, shipped overnight.  I flew home the next morning and found the generator waiting in my driveway.Setup was simple.  You need to attach the wheels and handles, fill with oil, fill with gas, and start her up.  Started on the first pull despite sitting out in below freezing weather all day.  I let the generator warm up for about 5 minutes, plugged in a lamp to test, and everything worked as expected.  I then connected a power cord to my oil furnace (disconnecting power cables in junction box between furnace and circuit breaker panel), plugged it in to the generator, and restored heat to the house.Over the next few days, I also hooked up several lights, our alarm clocks, our FiOS equipment, laptops, and phone chargers.  No issues.  I did not try the 240V connection.  There is not enough power to run my electric dryer or water heater, so I found no real need for 240V.  I didn't run my fridge because it was already too late -- I didn't get the generator hooked up until about two days after we lost power -- but I would hook up the fridge in the future.The power company finally restored power to our house about 50 hours after we first hooked up the generator.  We ran for a total of 35 to 40 hours.Some other things you might be interested to know:- I used Mobil 1 10W30 and changed the oil after the first night.  I have an oil extractor to &#34;suck&#34; the oil out, but you could probably drain by tipping the generator on it's side.  An oil extractor is clean and easy.- The generator ran my oil furnace for over 10 hours on a single tank.  The tank was near empty when I refilled, but 10+ hours is more than I expected.- The tank is labeled 4 gallons, but it seems to only take about 2.5 gallons.  (The tank was near empty when I refilled, and it was only 2.5 gallons.)- Put Stabil in your gas can before filling the generator.  I use Stabil in my gas cans for my lawnmower, tractor, leaf blower, weed whacker, jet ski -- it really helps avoid carb issues.- Plug things in after the generator is running, and unplug things before you shut it down.  I don't know if I would have an issue if I left things plugged in, but I don't want to find out.- Buy a few extension cords.- Generator makes noise, but we were able to sleep without issue.  My wife commented that it wasn't as loud as she expected.- Get a carbon monoxide detector and put it in the room closest to the generator.  We had no issues.Bottom line: Three hundred bucks to bring my house back to life was money well spent.  We are ready for the next ice storm, hurricane, or whatever surprise happens next.  We can run our furnace and fridge.  We will have lights.  I am happy with this purchase and would buy again.  You get much more for your money buying for Amazon than buying from the local big box store when everyone else is looking for a generator.",5,No power?

B003QVIXYU,A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"First... check your idler pulley and measure the diameter then check your tension assembly to see if they spin freely. On my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7 w/AC I wanted to replace the pulley on the automatic tension assembly... not the idler pulley on the left side under the alternator. Seems most sites use the words for both interchangeably but that doesn't mean you'll get the correct pulley. The Dorman site states this pulley has a diameter of 76mm (about 3"") but Amazon shows it as 4.5"" and not only is that incorrect that's about the size of the pulley on the tension assembly... which I thought I was buying. So, I'm partly to blame in the purchasing error because I didn't do enough research first but I did rely on the measurements. I have now purchased the automatic tension mechanism that was at fault and it came with a wheel. I should have pulled the belt first and then checked the tension assembly but that's what happens when you think you know it all. However, at about 11 bucks this is a pretty good price and... since I now have one... I'll replace the idler pulley and clean all the other pulleys while the belt is off. I also noticed that the bolt that holds the wheel on was worn and the wheel would wobble a bit, overheat the belt and cause it to start coming apart. I went through about 3 belts in the last 15 years and probably didn't drive more than 5,000 miles... I thought it was just the belt. This is a solid wheel and includes instructions... like stating you need to make sure the vehicle isn't running before you start replacement. It also includes the bushing but without a bolt you may have a problem like I did. Well worth 5-stars and I've been pretty happy with the Dorman products I have purchased. I think Rock Auto has a great site to determine what parts fit and the Dorman site is also very good... I'll check a little better next time before I assume anything. I have noticed that many listings here and on that big auction site will use words to describe something like this item that aren't always applicable... like ""Idler Tension Pulley""... and that is partly what led me to purchase the wrong item... and the fact that both parts look pretty much the same.In my application... as someone else mentioned... I had to use the old spacer/bushings and O-ring because the bushing that comes with this isn't correct... though that may not be the case in all applications.",5,Oops... wrong wheel for where I needed... and measurements are wrong in listing.,1391904000,0,0,Dorman,Dorman 419-610 Idler Pulley,11.8

I am currently a little over 100 miles on my new oil and there is already a considerable difference in my engine's response and feel.Just to clarify, my engine was performing quiet well before adding this product. This additive will not turn a neglected engine into a factory fresh engine. If you are expecting this, save your money for a rebuild instead.So far I've noticed my engine is quieter, smoother, has less vibrations at idle, and has a slight increase in MPG, according to my car's on board computer. On top of those perks the additive also reduces wear and tear on crucial engine components.I'm looking forward to the next thousand miles as the product sets in and will be including it in my scheduled oil changes from now on. To clarify, the additive needs to be added during each oil change for continued results. I will likely had half a can next time for my particular engine. You need to add 50ml for every quart of oil in your engine according to the instructions on the can. However, some are claiming to add half the amount after the first treatment.I would strongly recommend giving this additive a chance if you want to thoroughly protect and get the most performance from your engine.

B003UT3S6Q,A14Z6D3IRJ23F7,"This is by far the best wheel cleaner I've ever used. I've used both Meguiar's, Mother's and Chemical Guys. They all worked decently, I tend to prefer the Meguiar's Hot Rims over the rest; however it doesn't come close to how well this works. With 4 piston brembo calipers and hawk hps pads, my Evo's brakes spew out a TON of dust onto my wheels. It's a constant battle to keep them somewhat clean. If I let it sit on there too long and gather more road gunk, it was impossible to get off with Meguiar's (or anything else) alone, and would require scrubbing (sometimes with a harsh/dangerously hard bristled) brush. Not anymore! This cuts through caked on rims even after a couple months of horrible neglect.You might need to use two passes with it, depending how hard caked the gunk is. My advise is:-First spray the wheels with my meguiars soap and pressure wash them to get off as much as possible before applying this.-If you have a light cleaning (usually less then a couple weeks for my car), then you can get by with spraying two rims at a time. If you're going to have to scrub some of the gunked on mess it's probably best to do one rim at a time. Spray your rim(s) generously getting in your inner rim if possible, your lug nuts, etc.-The liquid will come out kind of greenish and then turn an orangish/redish as it breaks down brake dust. It has a very strong (like cat urine) odor that you just have to get used to.-Let it sit on there for a couple of minutes (usually don't want more then 5). You don't want it to dry on the rim, although having accidentally done this - it washed off no problem.-If it's a light cleaning you can probably get by with just pressure washing it clean at this point, although to make sure you get all parts of the rims I usually go over it withGriot's Garage 15704 Micro Fiber Wheel Wand, (Pack of 2). If the caked on mess requires harder scrubbing I'd recommend something like autogeek's ""speed master wheel brush"".This bottle usually last about 16 individual wheel cleanings. It makes it the most expensive option out there, but by far the best and safest! It is acid free and ph balanced, and is specifically designed to be safe on all rims. I use this on BBS, Enkei, and WedsSports rims that cost over 1000-1500/per, all the time. I have no worry that this can in any way danger them. A lot of other products out there can be a hit or miss, and especially if you have refinished rims it can be very risky. My BBS are refinished and so far this has not worn it off or damaged them whatsoever. If you're looking for a bit cheaper solution, there'sSonax 230500 Yellow Wheel Cleanerto use as a refill.

I've been washing the spokes and outer rim all along but forgot the polished deep dish part of the wheel. I just finished using product with a soft wheel brush for the first time and was shocked to rediscover the effect of clean highly polished deep dish spoke wheels. I sprayed it on, let it sit a minute, brushed the surfaces, hosed it off, wiped it down, done. No mussel required. Works wonderfully. P.S.

Just take off the cover, unplug the wire and tuck the connector back behind the grill.

I reckoned I could bunch up the extra length and tie wrap it someplace.  Which I did, but a much cleaner solution would have been a shorter wire.  Its a pity some place like Radio Shack doesn't carry this type of connector.  I suppose I can cut and splice, but that at present would rather leave it as is.

You don't want to have to do that with microfiber because those towels are many times the price of one of theseOne of the most difficult parts of a car to clean properly is the glass.  These towels are perfect for the job.  They have enough ""bite"" to dislodge most garbage from the outside glass and they absorb most of the glass cleaner.  These towels do the dirty work protecting the more expensive microfiber so it can do its job of buffing the glass to remove the final moisture and streaks.  It's an excellent combination.  After a proper cleaning, both inside and out with this combination, using Stoners, it's almost like there's no windshield at all.The price:peformance ratio is excellent and I wouldn't be without them.UPDATE: I have just received the towels I bought at Amazon.  It should be pointed out that these towels will require some break-in.

B003YJLAIK,AYGFPGFKAWOVM,"First of all, you must have a pressure reducer in your RV's fresh water line. The fixtures in all RV's are rated at a maximum pressure of 50 to 60 psi. Campground water pressure can be over 100psi. The surest way to burst a fitting or fixture is to let this high pressure water go into your city water inlet. This device is a cheap way to avoid that problem.There are pressure regulators that sell for a lot less than this one. They are fixed pressure reducers, mostly 45psi. They can be problematic. Check your RV's specs. My fixtures are rated at 60psi, so with this unit I can accurately set the city water pressure to what I like. I normally have it at 50 to 55 psi. This pressure vastly improves showers and dish washing. The pressure meter gives you an instant view of the water pressure...so if there is a problem, you can easily rule out the city water first.Some tips on using this device:1. This should be the first thing connecting to the campsite's city water connector. I follow this with a water filter and then my supply hose. By putting this regulator first, you protect your filter and hose as well.2. If you want to adjust pressure, do it ONLY with all water turned off inside the RV. Make sure that no water is running or filling anywhere. Once done, gradually move the adjusting screw a bit. Wait 10 to 20 seconds and look at the pressure. Once set, you can begin using water. When water is running, don't expect the reading to always be at the set pressure.3. Replace this unit after a year or two. All pressure reducers wear out. For safety, I replace mine every year. $50 isn't a bad investment in protecting my water system.4. Use a water filter! There are lots of inline filters available. Most screen out particles bigger than 30 microns or so. this is enough to protect your fixtures. These inline filters do not purify the water. They just remove sediment in the water line. We never drink campground water. We do carry a good quality purifying filter and bottled water.5. Avoid banging up the regulator. This unit is not indestructible. We keep it in a plastic container in our &#34;garage&#34; when we travel.SummaryYou will be surprised how much better a shower in the RV can be when you can control the city water pressure.

I am looking forward to this weekend when the temperature is supposed to get up to at least 62 deg.  Sitting in the sun will probably warm the metal up beyond 65 deg and so that will be the day to install them.Installed them using the supplied directions by cleaning the areas of contact with alcohol.  I can report that the adhesive strips are industrial strength.  Make sure that they are positioned perfectly before you let them touch the vehicle. Because the KC light bracket made it a little hard to position it I allowed the first one to touch the vehicle not correctly aligned. I was not sure that I was going to get it off.

B003ZAGI9E,A1Z7PH9LKWUUQ,"I love these ramps.  They're solid, so I don't worry about them collapsing like most other ramp designs; there's nothing to collapse.  They're lightweight, so they're super easy to move around and handle.  The removable front part gives way more room to work on things.  They're foam encased in basically a bedliner-type material, so weather doesn't bother them (I left a car sitting on them outside all winter once).  They're long and smoothly sloped so I can finally pull my low-ground-clearance cars up on them.  They're also really handy for things like my '95 Caprice and '04 Grand Marquis, where the front overhang and lower air dam make it a pain to get a regular floor jack underneath to the front crossmember; I can drive up on these and then use a floor jack to get the car farther up in the air for something like removing a transmission.  The relatively long length of these does make it more important to get out a tape measure and make sure they're parallel before pulling up on them, but that's a small price to pay for the incredible convenience.  The stops on the end are adequate to keep you from driving off unless you get too wild.I did buy the Race Ramps branded wheel chocks (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZAGPGU), which are not the chepaest chocks around, but are also of good quality.  It's important to chock the wheels when using ramps like these where there isn't really an indent for the tires - but the flat part is honestly wide enough that it shouldn't be a problem if you want to live dangerously.",5,Great ramps,1394409600,1,1,Race Ramps,Race Ramps RR-56-2 56&quot; Race Ramp - 2 Piece,228

I thought I wanted a gauge that would hold the reading when moved away from the tire as I had one years ago that had that feature. I found to get that feature in a quality gauge I would almost double my investment and I was no willing to do that.So,I decided to give this unit a try. After using this gauge I now find I prefer the way this gauge works better than one that holds the reading when released.  I find it is so easy fill my tire a few pounds over then tap the air release button to obtain the exact tire pressure needed in seconds and I'm done and off to the next tire. This thing I guess is a true racing gauge as I had no idea how it would speed up the process of inflating my tires to the exact correct pressure.I like the solid look and feel of quality and the glow in the dark face is cool looking.

The included instructions have text in addition to just pictures.To elaborate on the included directions I have included the comments below:The larger guards (for turn signal) have three tabs that line up with the light holder. These were slightly too tight to place over the corresponding area on the light assembly. Bending them out slightly allows the guard to be attached easier.  The longest tab needs to be attached first and then the others.  If you have bent out the tabs some be sure to press them back in after the guard is attached.For the smaller guard (side lights) the directions have you completely removing the assembly.  I found it difficult to press the tab holding the lens to the fender assembly to perform this action.

B0042KL7OM,A1IGZ01OS01D81,First this is not like a full size DA in power. Setting 1 is essentially vibrate as the pad with not spin unless making near 0 contact. Setting 2-3 are basically the same. Setting 4 you get some spinning but not really a useful amount for much other than light object finishing. 5&6 the tool becomes useful. To give you an idea I was applying wax with a microfiber pad at like 5 effectively. Even at setting 6 this tool is like level 2 on a normal DA. But this tool has some advantages in size and intensity. It fits everywhere which is great and it buffs chrome and grills very well without destroying the pad. I like how they advertise all of it's other uses as it would be very good for household things as well. This tool can definitely outdo the hand approach at higher settings but don't expect anything like a full size DA's power.

B0042KL7OM,A2GGO4EBLU8IPH,"This was the first small polisher I ever owned, and it was ok for light jobs.

It never broke or wore out on me, but I found I only used it for light, small jobs like motorcycles and then only if I was applying wax.  It just doesn't have enough power to handle heavier work and it bogs down or stops spinning.  I'm not talking about applying significant pressure either.  I could stop it with a couple fingers applying light pressure to the top.  For the price, it is still a player because it does serve a purpose for small detail jobs, and if you are just covering a small area.  I have added the Rupes Big Foot Mini to my polisher arsenal and it is a much more capable machine.  Admittedly, it also costs 2.5 times as much so I can hardly compare them.

There is no real blue tint to the light; at least that I can see (the Rendezvous has a reflector cap over the end of bulb, so that might make a difference).As always, when one headlight burns out, the second one will probably burn out soon anyway. It is always a good idea to replace headlights in pairs.The packaging for these lamps has to be some of coolest looking but stupid I have ever seen. They should design these packages so that you can remove the bulb easily without ever touching the glass capsule. The package should also protect the bulb while you are installing the bulbs. This package does neither. When you pull off the cardboard wrap, there are two thick clear plastic covers that fall off. The lamps are then held in a plastic base. You have to bend the two bases apart to get at the bulbs. Once the halves are separated, you have to really pull hard and wiggle the lamp to remove it from the plastic package.

Seemed like a lot of money to pop 2 clips, take filter out and put new one back in. Installation in this car was a lot easier than in other cars because the filter slots into the box, making the seal and closing of the air box effortless. I guess the tool that puts the filters in at the dealership is pretty expensive lol. This is almost 25-30$ more than the paper filter, but it flows a little more air, and still cheaper than the dealer. There is the 100K warranty thing, but requires services just as often as you'd replace a paper filter which costs about the same as the regular filter (part only, from amazon). Putting the filter in took me quite a while almost 30 minutes. That's only because there were quite a few leaves in the air box that I needed to vacuum, and my shop vac wasn't working so I had to get my house vac. Otherwise it would have been a 10-15 minute affair. As far as performance, and sound, I couldn't really tell any difference. I've used these filters on all my cars and I like the slight performance and mpg boost from them. With other cars that I've put it in, I usually notice a 1 mpg boost which makes me feel like the filter pays for itself.

It took me about 30 minutes to install it (hardest part is removing the bolts in front of the driver side seat).  I suggest an impact wrench if you have one; I used an 18&#34; socket arm to get enough leverage to loosen the bolts.

I would not suggest use for areas where you will be away from the Jeep for extended time or in remote areas for long.  It's a lock box, but the more time you give a thief, the more time they will have to spend to defeat this box!There are a couple of downsides that I would like to see Bestop consider:(1) Make the box slightly wider; ther is room on the non-sloped side to add an inch or so and would give more options to what would fit in the box(2) Run the padding all the way up on the sides of the box; some items will slide around in the box and could be damaged or scratched(3) MAKE one for under the passengers side seat as well!

I should have been more aggressive with the first (gold) step, but I was scared of doing something I couldn't undo.

B004HCM9H4,A3B21ZWOW9I4X7,"I purchased this wax as part of a complete car finish overhaul solution using pretty much all Meguiar's products from the claybar to the Ultimate Polish, Ultimate Quick Detailer spray and micofiber clothes. I did reviews for all of the products I used, including the polishing pad, except for the claybar which I purchased from a local store last year. The claybar works well so I can recommend that too.I have tried other Meguiar's wax products like the NXT 2.0, which I did not care for, and find this wax to be their best hands down. I used the included pad to apply the wax versus a machine and the Meguiar's microfiber clothes to remove it. I found it relatively easy to apply and remove although it took some effort when the sun started to go down and the wax was not drying well enough.  On that point, regardless of what the instructions may say, I prefer and have the best results when I apply wax to a completely cool surface. Especially if it's black like my car. When I say cool I mean completely cool. When applied on a cool surface and left to dry completely, it comes off easily. I normally finish a wax job with some Meguiar's Ultimate Quick Detailer anyway to bring out the final shine so it takes care of any smudges or wax residue left behind. I did a review on the detailing spray last year.The wax has been on for a few weeks now and has been through about four washes with, of course, Meguiar's Gold Class car wash, and is holding up very well. After washing I go over it with the detailing spray using the microfiber clothes to bring it to a nice shine. I suspect it will hold up for a few more weeks or more. I'll be sticking with this wax for sure. Has a nice smell too.Let me also mention, the wax only works as well as the car finish will let it. That goes for pretty much any wax. If you are serious about getting your car to look it's best you must and I mean must, start with a claybar. Period. Or you are wasting your time and will not get the best out of any wax. You may also need to use rubbing and polishing compound too depending on the results you want. Just saying.And no I do not work for Meguiar's. I have tried a lot of car care products through the years and  while I am not expert, I just happen to like their product line - no not everything they make, but I think I have found a nice suite of products I can rely on and recommend to anyone who is willing to put in the work and wants good results.",5,Nice Shine and Holds Up Well,1403136000,0,0,Meguiar&#39;s,Meguiar's G18216 Ultimate Liquid Wax - 16 oz.,20.95
B004HCM9H4,AG28H2VJ3EA1Y,"First, I'm giving this product 4 stars because I haven't had a chance to test the durability of this product.  I may upgrade the rating later.I bought this product because my Ranger has a LOT of exterior vinyl.  Use the wrong wax and the vinyl will stain and sometimes it's not easy to fix..  Trying to avoid all that vinyl while waxing becomes very tiresome so when I heard that Meguair's Ultimate Liquid Wax (MULW) didn't stain vinyl I bought a bottle.  That this wax can be applied out under the sun is a nice feature as well.I bought this from Amazon on Friday and on Monday it was on my doorstep.  A Prime membership is one of the best investments I make each year.I decided to give this product a severe test and waxed several border areas making no effort to miss the vinyl.  A few minutes later I buffed it off and I was satisfied that this wax will be my go-to wax for transition areas at least.  The waxed vinyl appears to have a deeper color and is not shiny.  I also applied the wax to a portion of my repainted tonneau cover and it worked just fine coming off easily and without leaving behind streaks.  I could easily do my whole ride with this product if I wanted.There have been numerous complaints about MULW on detailing boards because of streaking and I'd like to say that streaks seem to happen when the product is applied too heavily.  Heavy applications waste product and make the wax difficult to buff. You have to apply a light coat and when I say a light coat, I mean that you should be barely able to see the wax.  If you can see it easily, you put on too much.Unlike the paste wax, the foam pad Meguair's supplies is pretty decent.  It's not a sandwich-type pad, that's to say two thin pads separated by an air space so I decided to use the pad.Proper pad preparation is important as well for a good result..  I put down a circle of wax halfway from the center to the edge and used my finger to spread the product evenly over the surface.  Once the pad had the wax completely covering the application surface, I added about three additional drops to the pad and began to apply the wax.  I did not have to add additional wax until I'd waxed the running board and two chromed wheels.  Another two drops was needed for two more wheels and a running board.  See what I mean about applying it thin?  Follow these instructions and you can do a whole car with about an ounce (probably less) of this wax and one microfiber towel for buffing.After I finished waxing, I put the pad inside two sandwich bags purging as much air from them as possible so that the pad will not dry out.If you apply this wax properly, you should be able to get 20+ applications out of a bottle.  If you're only going to use one wax, this product should be on your short list.",4,A great convenience product.,1398038400,0,0,Meguiar&#39;s,Meguiar's G18216 Ultimate Liquid Wax - 16 oz.,20.95

B004HCOE8Q,A3B21ZWOW9I4X7,"I purchased this polish to remove swirl marks on my black 2007 Chrysler 300C. I used it with an electric buffer and a Chemical Guys BUFLC_103_8 - Lake Country Heavy Polishing Pad which I also reviewed separately.I watched a few Youtube videos to get a basic idea on how to use the product and followed the instructions on the bottle too. The product performed well, removing almost all of the swirl marks after one application. Some took a little more effort and some did not come completely out, but are barely noticeable now. I suspect I would need to use a bit more aggressive methods to get them out, but did not want to go that route.I learned quickly that the surface needs to be completely cool, which is stated on the bottle, or it can dry and be difficult to remove. I used Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber Towels (reviewed separately) to remove the product and the combination worked well. When I did have smudges or dried polish I removed it with Meguiar's G14422 Ultimate Quick Detailer, which I highly recommend and have reviewed previously. A nice side benefit is the product has a nice smell so you don't have to suffer through a couple hours of dealing with a foul odor.Overall I am very pleased with how this polish performed. I can't recommend using it without an electric buffer. I just think it would be too much work to be effective and way to time consuming. It took me a good 3-4 hours even with a buffer. But I got the results I was looking for and can recommend it for anyone looking to get rid of swirls and light scratches.

B004HCS4PK,AG28H2VJ3EA1Y,"Like most of Meguair's products in my experiences Ultimate Paste Wax is easy to use, especially if applied in a thin layer.  Applying the wax heavily simply wastes product and creates a mess as many others have noted.  One of the best ways to insure a proper application is to use a proper application pad.  Throw the pad that Meguiars provides in the trash.  Use a Lake Country CCS applicator pad instead.  You get two pads for $5.  But if you want the very best application method, use a DA polisher with a finishing pad.  This is how you get the thinnest application and it will buff right off because with a extremely thin layer the wax (actually a sealant) dries very quickly.According to AutoGeek, this wax can indeed be applied in the sunshine but I have never tried it.  My guess is that if the surface is warm, my guess is that you can wipe it on and the buff it off.  Since I've never tried this I really don't have a recommendation for applying in the sun but the commentary on this product at AutoGeek says the product is ""foolproof"" so it can't be too hard to do.The paste can be applied to the pad by patting the pad into the paste.  Wiping the pad in the paste will load it up too much though if you're starting out with a new pad, you may have to wipe the pad into the wax just a bit.  If you're doing it right, You will be putting down a layer of wax that will be hard to see.Once the applicator pad is properly coated with wax, it will be good to keep it protected until you need to wax again.  The paste can has enough internal space to store the pad.As for vinyl/rubber trim, I've come to change my mind about it staining these materials.  I have tried it on some vinyl trim and it seems to buff off just fine.I look for this wax to last about 3-4 months unless the car is exposed frequently to a combination of high temperatures and rain like what we see in Georgia during the summer.  I haven't had enough time to evaluate the wax's ability to cope with bird bombs and bug splats.",4,A very competent wax.,1397433600,1,1,Meguiar&#39;s,Meguiar's G18211 Ultimate Paste Wax - 11 oz.,19.68

Well, with this little gem I no longer need to use a screwdriver and a separate tire gauge.  Just screw the business end of this ARB deflator onto your tire's valve.  Then, take the small secondary knurled knob on the back of it and push it forward while turning counter-clockwise.  That smaller knob actually unscrews your tire's internal valve stem and holds onto it, allowing for a much faster deflate.  Use the sliding collar on the deflator to periodically check your tire's pressure, and once achieved, keep the collar in the closed position and use that back knob again to re-install the valve stem.  Don't overtighten that little inner valve stem too hard, as they have tiny threads.  Remove the entire deflator and move on to the next tire.

However stopping at a place and plugging them is not convenient and wastes your time. Before buying this, my only solution was to fully charge everything before leaving home and during my hotel stays or bring an extra camera battery. Yet again that is not the perfect solution either.When I ran out of my camcorder charge while on a very scenic trip, the frustration of not being able to record made me decide buying one of these. I first hesitated buying due to some reviewers saying it burnt, or they were almost catching fire etc. (these things actually happen in many electrical items but very rarely once used properly) so I went for that and bought it. So far I have not experienced anything close to that. It is a single piece item: no cords to get loose (permanent attachment of the charging cord to the actual charger) or get lost... I still keep it in its bubble wrap under the driver seat. It is not heavy but heavier than a laptop adapter and it charges small items easily without keeping you off from your way.Having two USB charging ports is a plus too so that you don't need to daisy-chain this to a 12V multiplier that has USB function, however if you have a GPS charger then you still need an 12v multiplierBESTEK usb adapter car cigarette lighter socket car splitter adapter 4 way plug socket usb outlet dc charger power adapter 12V socket 24V dc adapter car charger Ipad Dual USB charger 2.1A MRS152UVto stick both in.

It feels like it is metal outside with some sharp edges that can scratch the plastic parts of your car during your trip if not placed well. Besides, I am also worried that it could pose a big risk in case of a crash... I don't want to imagine a brick size sturdy object flying in the car.

B004NFTOLY,AC6Z7DP1Z5GHD,"I added this to my RV so that I could tune in TV stations easily. Some Digital TV's do have a signal strength indicator, but not all.  In those instances, this meter comes in handy.There are two minor issues though, and the first one really is not the fault of Winegard, as I am not sure what the solution is.The issue is that prior to going digital, TV stations used their Analog channel number for their identity. For example, a local TV station in my area always calls themselves ""Channel 8"" in addition to their call letters, which was of course their broadcast channel.But when we went digital, they still use the Channel 8 moniker, but that is no longer accurate as they broadcast on channel 20.  There is the problem. The Winegard Sensar Pro displays the true digital number, so in the above example, I would have to set the display for channel 20 to tune in ""Channel 8"" to the max signal.Unfortunately, there is no standard cross reference between the old analog and new digital channels, so you have to go to a website such as [...] and enter the station's call letters to get the true digital channel.As I said, there is no real solution, so I don't fault Winegard for that. They display the true digital signal, which is really the only solution.If you are going RV'ing to a specific destination, the easiest thing to do is go to one of the channel identity websites and get the channel information before leaving.The only real improvement I could see is when the device is turned off. Even in the off position, a LED is on. OK, one LED does not take a lot of current - maybe 10mA, but over time, say a week boondocking, that 10mA will result in loss of 2AH of battery power.  And 2AH here and 2AH there, pretty soon it adds up to a significant load.I added a disconnect switch so I could completely disconnect the Sensar Pro so there would be no current drain whatsoever for boondocking purposes. The current drain - even in the off position is the primary reason for 4 stars rather than 5, since at least occasional boondocking is a real possibility for a RV.",4,Great acessory.,1400025600,0,0,NA,NA,120.75

B004NFTOLY,A2OKRGHIYTBQ6P,"Digital TV has given us beautiful HD images, but if you've repeatedly gone through the ordeal of guessing where to aim your RV antenna, scanning for channels, then readjusting the antenna and re-scanning to see what you missed, you know that is a nuisance.  This device offered to solve that problem, so I ordered one.My 2011 Itasca Sunova 33C motorhome came equipped with aWinegard RVW-395 Sensar IV White DTV/HD TV Antennaand built-in amplifier, so I anticipated that replacing the factory-installed antenna amplifier with this SensarPro would be a simple swap job.  How wrong I was!  The factory-installed Winegard amplifier was mounted on a steel panel in a cabinet above the front passenger seat.  Unfortunately, the opening provided by the RV manufacturer for that booster was dramatically smaller than the opening that is required for this SensarPro.  This was no simple swap job.  Fortunately, I had a nibbling tool in my shop, some good files and old metalworking skills, so I went to work enlarging the hole in that steel plate.Complicating the work, this SensarPro requires screw tabs projecting into the top and the bottom of the rectangular mounting hole.  They're like the tabs you often see on metal electric outlet boxes.  It was lengthy, tedious work nibbling and filing that steel plate, but I'm delighted to say that my work was rewarded.  The RV factory had installed a splitter behind the panel to feed two TV from the original Winegard amplifier.  This SensarPro has connections for two TVs, so I was able to get rid of the splitter, thereby boosting the signal.After mounting this device on the panel opening I made and established all of the connections including the required 12-volts DC, oriented my antenna for optimum signal strength shown on the SensarPro panel, set the amplifier's gain at maximum and ran a TV channel scan.  Having my motorhome parked about halfway between New York and Philadelphia, I was able to pick up 46 digital channels.  The SensarPro instructions suggest setting the gain at 10, but my best results came from the maximum setting 20.  Perhaps if I'm closer to TV stations, I'll need to reduce the gain.  Thus far, I have been pleased with my purchase..",5,Greatly Simplifies Aiming my RV Antenna,1399680000,1,1,NA,NA,120.75

B004P91FCO,APKD4O1I1IJF8,"I won't rehash all the glowing reviews about this sets' superior construction and content. I will say that both its handles survived multiple whacks with a drive hammer and survived. It is billed as a ""4x4"" repair kit for off road tires, but will also work quite well on passenger car tires.So here's my experience with a few pointers to make things easier.First after you gather all the tools, lube, cement (more on this later), pre-thread the rope plug through the needle, making sure you have 2 even length plug 'legs' bent upwards towards the handle. Locate the puncture, pre-lube the reamer and have at it per the instructions. You really will have to twist and drive the reamer past the tread belts. Although you can repair a tire on the car, you need so much leverage to drive the reamer, (and the plug needle) through the tread and tread belts, it will be difficult. I would estimate 50-75lbs of arm pressure is needed to push through. The tougher the tire (i.e. LT type tires with a lot of tread), the more you will have to push. Here's tip # 1; take advantage of the removable handle on the reamer (hex key supplied with kit), and attach just the tool shaft to your electric drill--instant ream job! Just don't overdo it!Now that you've rounded and trimmed off the puncture all the way through the tread, cord, and belts, use the reamer as a 'plug' to stop any additional air from escaping. Things go better with air pressure in the tire since it supports the tread around the 'target area', so don't let the whoosh of escaping air rattle you.Next, remove the reamer. Air will escape, but if you have about 20-25 PSI of air pressure left in the tire, you will have plenty of time to grab your loaded plug needle and put it in the hole. My first repair was rear tire on a sports car. Very limited working space=very little leverage. I could not drive home the plug. Tip #2. The solution was to coat the plug and needle with rubber cement(purchase separately as it is not supplied)(disclaimer: I think this was mentioned in a previous review-thanks). The cement acted as a lubricant, and while still difficult, I finally was able to drive the plug home. In my case, the kit-supplied lube was ineffective. It probably would have been different if I removed the tire however.Note: This is an ""open eyelet"" kit. The plug 'needle' has a open slot to facilitate its removal from the tire whilst leaving the plug in place. DO NOT rotate the needle when driving the plug into the puncture. You risk spreading/breaking the eyelet off the needle shank within the tire, or jamming up the eyelet with the twisted plug.Feel free to drive the plug all the way into the tire until the sliding cone stops your motion. NO fear of going too far. Put pressure on the sliding cone, holding it against the tire, while pulling the needle out. The plug is now perfectly seated in the puncture. Just trim the leftover exposed nub with a blade, leaving about 1/8"" excess above the tread, so it can be further seated by the rolling tire.One final point, you really need to carry, or have access to, an air compressor or air pump to re-inflate your repaired tire. Otherwise driving on a severely under inflated tire is inviting a blow out.Like everything else, this kit has it's limitations. It probably won't work if you have impaled a railroad spike as you cannot 'double up' the plugs. Also, side wall repair is out-too much flexing. Same with angled punctures.  However, when done properly, the self vulcanizing plugs should last the remaining life of the tire.

ONR is far cheaper, and more concentrated, and gives similar results.Even in the gallon size i'm hesitant to suggest this product- it can't be applied in sun, and must be wiped immediately, since it &#34;flashes&#34; off very quickly.

B004UPZXI0,A2ES8N7CVWICZY,"Having some experience with spray detailers, I had an idea what to expect. Basically some gloss, a slick surface, and short-term protection. There is some controversy regarding whether water beading is a sign of good protection, but I won't get into that. What water beading (or sheeting) does accomplish is it at least shows the presence of product.There's another way to show presence of a car wax/sealant that a car detailer showed me years ago, and that's the steam test. It doesn't measure protection, per se; it just shows the presence of a product so you can see how uniformly it covers an area, how easily it comes off, etc. Basically you coat some product onto a bathroom mirror and allow steam to build up in the room. Areas of the mirror coated in wax/sealant will have a uniform layer of steam that is different from untreated areas. It won't repel steam, the barrier causes tiny water droplets to build up uniformly, (appearing as if there is 'more' steam there). You can try it yourself and see what I mean.I bring this up because after noticing that the V7 just didn't seem to do as much as other similar sprays (the gloss was fair but not very good, and I didn't notice the extra water beading that other spray detailers provided at least short term), I wanted to see what it was leaving behind. I did the test, using the V7, along side a couple other spray detailers.The results surprised me. The areas treated with V7 left very little behind, with some streaks of presence. I also applied some Meguiars UQW and Turtle Wax Ice, both of which showed solid coverage (and the TW had remarkable durability to removal, incidentally).  When I applied two more coats of V7 over its area, it began to show more signs of coverage, confirming my results: This appears to be an extremely watered-down detailer, high in alcohol so that it ""flashes"" (evaporates) quickly. It came completely off with a bit of soapy water, whereas the other products actually were rather stubborn to remove.I give it two stars because as a quick detailer, it's fine. It will clean off fine dust and fingerprints, and leave a wee bit of shine. In the gallon size the value is fair, but $18 or so per bottle is silly, seeing as how it has just about zero sealant properties and even the shine it leaves is inferior to some $8 spray waxes.I've heard that CG is hit and miss with their products, but V7 is generally regarded as one of the hits. In my experience, it is not. Maybe they make some good stuff, but this isn't it. I don't want to judge the company by one product, so I'll give another one of their products a try, probably.  I gotta say, they do a really good job with graphic design on their packaging; especially the ""vintage"" line.

The handle has a long rod that is pressed into the sponge & is secured with glued.  I pulled it off to see what going on.  The rod was glued sparingly in only 2 places.  The glue placed towards the end had failed.  I reapplied glue to see if I could secure the handle rod back in the sponge.This is VERY annoying after only 2 uses!

Its a good idea to use a relay kit to power up your HID's but it would be nice is the wires were long enough to reach the battery. This is a very easy plug and play setup, but no play if I cant wire it to the battery. Im going to have to splice more wire between the fuse and relay to make the wire long enough to reach the battery on the Saturn Vue. Not so much of a big deal, but the more cuts in a wire the higher the residence (ohms) you make. Working with high power car audio, you never make any unneeded cuts in your wiring. Voltage has to stop at each cut before it reaches the end and that's something good installers don't want. Like I said good relay kit, made very well just the wires could be longer. Even the wires to the HID's could be longer. Or GM before placing the battery should of thought ahead for something like this. I bought a set of HID's for a 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis and ordered the relay kit for that too. Big car, wonder how short the wires on the relay kit will be for that?3/24/14 Installed the relay kit. I had to add 5 inches to the main fused power wire, was a little short. All in all everything is working good and I put the fuse back in for my day time running lights and they even work good now. No more one light off and the other on. But I pulled the fuse out anyways. The HID's are on a timer with life.

B0058WXNOK,A2DGBX9H39N082,"I had a whole in the seat upholstery in my Jeep. The surface was cracked all around the hole, so it was sort of a spiderweb. I used the adhesive that comes with the kit to fill the hole and cracks, and it seems to work okay. It is white, but dries clear. Then you do the hard part. You get a number of small containers of the surface material (sort of like thick paint) which you have to combine and mix to get the right color.  That is harder than it seems.  If you have black upholstery you are in luck. In other cases you are going to be mixing.  You use a small tool that comes with the kit to mix and spread the surface material over the repaired area, matching the color (hopefully) and filling in any remaining imperfections. You then have to cover the repaired area with the 'paper' material in the kit, so the finish will match the grain. Then you have to apply heat to the surface (covered with the paper) to cure the surface material. You get a 'tool' to do this - a piece of wooden dowel rod with a dime size metal disk on the end.  You are told to heat it on an iron, and rub the paper.  I did this a few times, but it was taking forever for the heat to dry and cure the glue. Then I pulled out the old reliable travel iron (which we don't use), and heated it to the cotton level, and use the tip of the iron to rub the paper.  That worked much better that the little tool. The end result is a patch.  You can see it - probably because of the slight difference in color.  The patch is flexible which is perfect for a seat area. Best of all, the spiderweb is not expanding. So, all in all, it did what I wanted it to. If you can do a better match on the color you will be more satisfied.

B005ASY23I,A2MFHJ08ZX3O61,"I got this to maintain tires for our 3 family cars and to occasionally help some of my friends to do the same. I've used this for a few weeks and I'm already impressed by it - the physical build quality is great, no loose or rattling parts, the compressor is not overly loud and doesn't &#34;jump&#34; all around the pavement during the work. The hose and the screw-on chuck are also pretty sturdy and feel like they would last a very long time. The built-in pressure gauge is fairly accurate (just make sure to turn compressor off before looking at the gauge) but you should still get a separate dedicated tire pressure gauge (preferably not some cheap plastic crap with digital display). The only minor drawback is the lack of the storage bag but it's not an issue if you primarily store it at home and you can find plenty of aftermarket bags which can easily fit this in. Overall it's a great product and much, much better than various similar products by more &#34;recognizable&#34; brand names.One minor warning, though - make sure to measure the distance between your car's battery terminals and the rear tires on your vehicle BEFORE purchasing this model. The attached power cable and the hose are long enough for most cars and compact SUVs but you might need to order power cable extension or purchase a different model (Viair sells plenty of these) with longer cable/hose if you have a pickup truck with a long bed length or a large SUV.",5,Very good compressor for its price,1403395200,0,0,Viair,Viair 00088 88P Portable Air Compressor,69.9

B005ASY23I,A204K1OFE8OB9Y,The good is that it is well made and has sturdy construction and should last for years. The hose it comes with attaches to the tire valve by threading onto it which is great and works much better than the ones you need to keep pressed against the valve stem. In part this feature is also a necessary one as the hose needs to be threaded and left attached to the tire while you turn on the compressor.The one aspect of the design that I do not like is that it clips onto the battery posts instead of having a plug for a cigarette lighter socket. My battery for my truck is on the left front side and with my SUV on the right front corner of the engine compartment. the Battery cables to power the compressor are long enough to have the compressor sitting on the ground while it is operating but the air hose has to be able to reach all four tires. You really need to buy at least one of the Viair 6 foot extension hoses with the threaded fittings at both ends (male and female).I was barely able to reach the right rear tire of my short bed extended cab truck using the 88P's hose and the 6' extension hose. Not a concern with small sedans but if I had a long bed truck with a crew cab or an RV I would need two or more of the 6' extension hoses to reach all the tires.There is a pressure gauge but it is not accurate. This is to be expected as the air coming out of the compressor is very hot and so the reading cannot be accurate. I used the TPMS to know the actual amount of air in the tires as the compressor ran and then double checked with a hand air pressure gauge that I know is accurate (most are not). I put in 2-4 lbs. more than the spec for the tires and let them cool down for several hours and then rechecked and adjusted the pressure in each tire.I was adding air to truck tires that needed 80 PSI and this 100 PSI rated compressor did very well in adding 8-10 lbs. of air per tire. I had to let out a lot of air to reset the TPMS sensors on my truck after a tire dealer rotated the tires and failed to do the reset. They have never done the reset unless I catch them and then have them do it before I leave. For someone with load range G/H tires that need 100 or greater PSI I would go to the next compressor in the Viair line that is rated for 150 PSI.The compressor power cables include a fuse and holder which is a nice touch and protects the electrics and with a compressor is better than a thermal fuse that would be tripping all the time. The compressor package includes an adapter for sports equipment.I need to get a case for it as it ships with a box that is not going to hold together in the truck and it is too small to hold the needed 6 foot extension hose. This is not a negative comment only something to consider if you plan to leave this in your car or truck.,5,Great compressor if you work within its limitations,1403222400,0,0,Viair,Viair 00088 88P Portable Air Compressor,69.9

B005C2ACBI,A49W7XK0KETAT,"It's worth understanding that unlike typical ratcheting straps, the handle has two ""rest"" positions.  One of the jobs of the red tab is to jump the handle from one position to the other.  In one position, the device works like a seat belt retractor, with the strap able to pay out or self-retract, just like seatbelts in a car.In the other position, the handle works like a typical ratcheting strap system.  HOWEVER, even in this position, realize that these straps are made of seatbelt material, which is kind of slick, so the wound up material will slip over itself on the spool quite a bit before you get maximum belt tension.When you ratchet the belt down, keep tightening until all this ""slip"" or ""slack"" is pulled out.  Then tighten it some more for good measure!  And most importantly, when you're done tensioning, DO NOT return the handle to the ""seat belt retractor mode"" position, or you can lose tension all together.  With normal ratchets, you're probably used to returning the handle all the way back down flat prior to hauling.  On this product, that's bad, because putting the handle all the way down flat is the ""retractor mode"" position!  You'll need to leave the handle slightly up for ""locking-ratcheting mode"".  It will look funny, but it is the position it needs to be in.I can see a situation, in some applications, where the hustle and bustle of freight handling can cause the lever to be unintentionally whacked down flat into the ""retractor mode"" position, which may cause the belt to go slack.  That is a risk.  For my application, these are wonderful, and greatly simplify tidying up your straps.",5,"A Small Learning Curve, But Great Once You Figure Them Out",1403395200,0,0,Erickson,Erickson 34416 Pro Series Black 2&quot; x 10' Retractable Ratcheting Tie-Down Strap,55.99

B005CHT4W6,A91BVZEDZYEWW,"Rotella is a fantastic oil and T6 is the icing on the cake!I have been in construction for over 40 years and I can tell ya that the preferred brand for our heavy equipment (dozers, loaders, excavators and such) has always been Rotella.  And now with T6 you just get more of a great thing.  Tried and true and may they never stop making great diesel engine oil.I get mine at Walmart for 21something a gallon.  Not 100% sure, but swear I get an extra 1mpg in my Duramax now that I switched over to the T6 from the regular Rotella T.  Best part is my cost only went up by about $8 a gallon - or $20 an oil change.  Knowing that most engine wear happens at start-up and that synthetic holds the edge with cold circulation abilities, I love being able to switch over to synthetic for so little money.*******************************************************************************************************************************************************Edit:  Wanted to add that I spoke with Shell Tech Support to confirm that T6 is fine to use in all ambient temps.  As some may have noticed, it is a 5W-40 and if it were a conventional oil you most likely would not want to use it in a hot climate like Vegas.  But being full SYNTHETIC, there is no issue whatsoever - IT IS GOOD FOR ALL CLIMATES.  Oh and he was able to confirm too that I can absolutely use it in my Honda Goldwing as well.  However, NOT in any engines that call for 0W-20.  Just an fyi for yas, the 0W-20 requirement of some engines is not to be played with as there are tight ports that could otherwise easily be clogged by any higher weight oils.  Deviate from that at your own risk.And finally, with the $5 rebate they keep running, my Duramax oil changes are now only about $8 more using Synthetic T6 over Regular Rotella Triple T.  And I ""can"" extend those oil change intervals if I wish.  Awesome!  Love this stuff.  Oh, and they claim a 4 year shelf life, but that has more to do with liability over future oil advancements than it does with oil ""spoiling"".  Mobil 1 claims 5 years.  Keep the lid closed tightly and store your oil between 32-100F and use it within 5 years and all should be good.One last note about SYNTHETIC OIL so as to be clear that I do not make a blanket statement that it should be used by all.  There are certain benefits that synthetic brings with it's higher price and if you feel these are something that you want then use it.  They are:* Better cold starts when MOST engine wear occurs.* Excellent cold weather pour-ability and lubricity.* Slightly better mileage.* Longer engine life (mainly because of the better cold starts), however, maybe ask yourself when's the last time you ran an engine to death.* You ""can"" go with longer engine oil change intervals simply because synthetic tends to take longer to break down than conventional.

The seat is fine but the back will not stay in place when you are getting in and sitting down&#8230; it slides all the way down to the seat cushion.

That&#8217;s not easy to do and you shouldn&#8217;t have to do it in the first place. The elastic straps for the back are pretty useless&#8230; even on other brands&#8230; and the only way I can see to keep it in place is to have a cloth seat that you could put some furniture screws into it and attach it directly to the seat back&#8230; which I&#8217;m not inclined to do on leather.

B005G7SBY4,A1YUWK0O71JG0W,"I have a large collection of rechargable and non rechargable batteries that I use for different purposes. Sometimes it is not very easy to distinguish the flat ones from the full ones and this small handy item does a great job for this purpose. I had spared more than 15 old batteries for recycling assuming they were flat and half of them turned up to have good level of charge in them. I may use them for clocks or other less demanding stuff. This is a very good item that can be used to test all common battery types and would eventually save one good amount of money. I hope it lasts.UPDATE after 1 week: I have concerns on the accuracy of the reading for button batteries. I bought a brand new set of button batteries (CR1616) for my watch and just out of curiosity tested one with this tool. First it is very difficult to get it in the place and second after the indicator needle wandered up and down a little while it showed  the 'replace' area. Which I believe is totally wrong. Then I tested it with two other brand new button batteries from different types (LR44 and CR2032)The reading with LR44 was consistent and accurate but CR2032 behaved somewhat similar to CR1616 (the needle jumped up and down then decreased back to 'replace battery area') I think the circuit in some button batteries is not strong enough for this device. For that case, I think if you see the needle at least once going up then assume that the battery is ok, do not expect it to stabilize in the green zone.Despite this flaw about button batteries, I still rate this item 5 stars due to its value for price rate and accuracy in major battery types.

B006A49KJC,A1JUBRIZMO0RJV,"Pennzoil Ultra is the company's top of the line motor oil.  Shell, parent company of Pennzoil, engineered this 5w-40 European Full Synthetic product to meet the tough European Specifications.  Indeed, you would be hard pressed to find a common late model gasoline European vehicle that is not covered by this product (always double check though).Its approvals include Mercedes-Benz 229.5, BMW LL-01, Porsche A40, Ferrari, Maserati, Fiat, VW 505.00, and VW 502.00.These specifications all speak to the quality of the product. In particular, Mercedes-Benz 229.5 (used in the majority of gasoline engine Mercedes cars the past decade) is particularly tough to meet.In normal operating conditions, when you have a European vehicle, an approved oil allows you to comfortably run the full oil change interval recommended by your manufacturer.  Some of these European manufacturers have very long oil change intervals, which is why the correct oil with a strong additive package is so very important.Due to licensing, very few products meet current Ferrari specifications in North America.  This is about your only choice if you have a Ferrari in North America (you must be very happy if you have that Ferrari), and that specification sets this product apart from its rival European products from Mobil and Castrol which do not meet Ferrari spec.  The technical specs are all impressive.  This product has a very low NOACK volatility and proper viscosity for the majority of European vehicles in most climates.This is a highly recommended product. Depending on price and your personal preferences, Mobil 1 0w-40 is another terrific option that meets most of the same specifications besides Ferrari, Maserati, and Fiat.",5,One of the Best Motor Oils for European Vehicles!,1391385600,7,8,NA,NA,45.81

These are way brighter and I can see all the indicators clearly during the day and they are NOT blinding me at night.A few extras for people who are interested:The bulb is a single lens SMD5050 that operates at ~3V and draws ~30mA. In order to allow it to work with 12-14V car installations, there are two resistors in the bulb housing, 180 Ohm each. So the total power draw is 420mW at 14V, out of which 90mW ends up in the LED to give you the light.So far I have not noticed them turning blue over time or anything like that. Nice, bright white, probably around 5000K.One bulb came in slightly damaged (wires were embedded in the plastic housing), but I was able to fix it with a pocket knife.I'm very satisfied with these.",5,Very bright and don't get hot,1402358400,0,0,NA,"Jtech 10 x T5, 5050 SMD LED White Car Lights Bulb",3.99
B007G7PUMS,A1JUBRIZMO0RJV,"Castrol EDGE 0w-30 SPT Synthetic Motor Oil has been loved and raved about by European car owners for a decade now.  It is one of Castrol's premier products in that it meets so many tough European specifications including Mercedes-Benz 229.5, BMW LL-01, VW 505.00, and VW 502.00.These specifications all speak to the quality of the product. In particular, Mercedes-Benz 229.5 (used in the majority of gasoline engine Mercedes cars the past decade) is particularly tough to meet.The product has often been referred to as German Castrol because for many years it was produced in Germany.  Now, you may still find it made in Germany, but some cases are showing up from Belgium.  Rest assured, it is still the high quality product meeting the tough European specifications no matter where it is produced.The low pour point of this product, approximately -50 Degree Centigrade suggests it has a significant percentage of Group IV Synthetic base stock in its formulation. Group III base stock is also high quality today, but the fact remains that Castrol is putting very high quality ingredients into this premier product. Of course, the oil companies today never tell us the exact formulation, so we can only take best guesses. Nevertheless, it is clear that it is a high quality product no matter what base stock is used because it does officially meet the tough European specifications listed on the bottle.When you have a European vehicle and you use a motor oil that meets the manufacturer specifications, you can feel comfortable going to the full maintenance interval recommended by your manufacturer under normal conditions.This is a highly recommended product. Depending on price and your personal preferences, Mobil 1 0w-40 is another terrific option that meets the same specifications as well as a few additional ones.Note - This product seems similar to Castrol's new 0w-40 product.  One difference though is that Porsche requires a 40 weight, so the 0w-40 product meets Porsche specification while this 0w-30 product does not.",5,Superb European Oil Formulation!,1391385600,5,5,NA,"Castrol 06244 EDGE 0W-30 SPT Full Synthetic Motor Oil - 1 Quart Bottle, (Pack of 6)",43.9

B007VJ2K9M,A1R3T01MVZU6Z5,"Sanctiond tire glaze gel works really well on tires.  It is a thick gel with a consistency (kind of) like maple syrup.  This allows for the gel to be applied to tires and keeps the gel from running off tires onto rims or quarter panels while driving (referred to as slinging).  A small amount of product goes a long way; more product = higher shine.  You can achieve a subdued, fairly long lasting shine with one coat.  For a high gloss tire, run a second coat and your tires will really gleam.  I have applied about three times to each of the four tires on both an SUV and a coupe (24 tires total) and still have about 3/4 of the bottle left.  For what it is worth, my method to apply is by pouring a small amount into a bowl (I use the top of an old spray paint can) and then use a paint brush to ""paint"" the gel onto the tires.  This allows me to conserve the product while ensuring that I get even, complete coverage on the tires.  Hopefully that hint can work for you too.  I recommend this tire glaze as it is of high quality and the pricing is reasonable.  The only product I have ever used that came close was the old formulation of Stoner's MoreShineLessTime, but that product has been reformulated and is no longer as effective.  Good luck.

Come to find out from my Nissan Tech friend, this is the same oil the dealership buys in 55 gallon drums, and uses in there auto trans drain and refills.  And I also found out that Castrol makes the trans fluid (this one) that goes into the Nissan labeled bottles sold at the dealership for $12 a quart (Matic-J). Per there website, this fluid is a direct replacement for Nissan Matic-J, Matic-D, and Matic-K trans fluids. FYI, you need 4.5 quarts for a drain and refill on a 2005 Nissan Frontier.If your Nissan uses Matic-S, I do not believe this fluid will work in your vehicle. You might contact Castrol directly before purchasing to verify the compatibility. I listed the differences between the two below:Nissan Matic-J (semi-synthetic automatic transmission fluid) this one is being phased out to only Matic-SNissan Matic-S (fully-synthetic automatic transmission fluid)From what I was told by my Nissan Tech friend, if your owners manual states that your vehicle requires Matic-J fluid, then you can mix and use both Matic-J and Matic-S fluids in your transmission.

I have already bought a couple of LED lights elsewhere and I am very happy with them but the cost was too high to replace them all in my camper. I bought these 2 lights to try before buying a 20 set. The first thing to watch out for is the wires on both of these lights were crossed when I tried to install them the first time. This resulted in a quick pop and a little char on the light fixture. I removed the lights and bent what was left of the wires into place. The second try worked well. The resulting light is very blue and nowhere near as bright as my other LED lights.

Mind you they cast sufficient lighting and the wattage saving for dry camping is significant and they are cool to the touch.  However, if you are a full-hook up camper and don't NEED the wattage savings I wouldn't bother with the expence.  They are polorized so installing them is side specific therefore it's a 50-50 chance you have to rotate them on the install.

The quick disconnect allows for you to remove the batter or the device with out having to un wire everything. The on off allows me to know that for some reason it isnt going to drain my battery. On thing that wasnt very clear until I downloaded the instructions that the when it it mounted to the bike, The device must be facing upward inorder to be water proof. Also I wouldnt charge a device in the rain. My only con with this is that the battery connections are staggered so that it can only be placed on the right side of the battery or what ever side the positive battery terminal is.

Overall, it gives more clearance lighting when reversing, thus improving safety conditions, all while giving it a more unique look.Update: No problem at all from the diode, which is awesome! I got more experimental when I researched and bought some load resistors, and went ahead and bought two pairs of these for my turn signals.

Much to my surprise and delight this assembly of LEDs was as bright, as measured by my Gossen Luna-Pro light meter, as the 12V flat-based filament bulb that it replaced.  The color of the light from these LEDs is very close to daylight white but not blue like other LEDs that I've tested nor orange like the light from the factory-installed filament bulbs.Each of my Itasca motorhome's overhead ceiling light fixtures contains two flat-based bulb sockets.  There is adequate space within the fixture to install two of these panels with adapter, behind the fixture's diffuser.  The LED panel consumes considerably less power than the filament bulb it replaced and emits less heat, but it still gets warm.  I've ordered additional light panels from another Amazon vendor that sells them for less, and I plan to use them to replace most of the filament bulbs in my fixtures.Short term, my experience with this light panel has been very positive.

I was surprised to see that I got as much or more out after the first flush then simply draining it alone. Then again, I figured surely there couldn't be a need to flush a new tank twice, but I tried it anyway, and again was surprised to see more waste flush by. Then of course, I just had to see if a third time would net the same results, and I again saw more stuff fly by.

B009X23B2U,A393MV5JXZF5AP,The switch pod fits well as a replacement for the factory item.  You can not tell the difference between the color of this pillar and the surrounding factory plastic.  I installed switches in all 4 locations because it seemed that it would be better to do that than to take it off later to add switches. I purchased the switches from a different manufacturer because I liked the styling of them better.  For whatever switches you purchase you have to cut out the switch openings.  I think the mfg should punch out the plastic at the factory and then placed a plastic cover over the openings.If you are good with an Exacto knife it will be easy to cut the openings for the switches; the plastic is soft.  The included instructions are well written and clear with good pictures.  For the price they should include some hardware with it (the reason for 4 stars) For one metal clip they have you take the plastic wire track cover off of the rear tailgate and use the one in the middle.  There is also a plastic clip that holds in the existing pillar.  This clip tends to break when you remove the old pillar.  They could have included this hardware and received 1 more star.When I installed my switches I used #12 gauge wire and so the pillar was a little difficult to try to mount.  What did help was to run the wires through one of the u-shaped supports on the back of the pillar.  Once installed the pillar looks good.  I had installed long wires for the switches that were long enough to run under the dash.  There is plenty of room under the dash and that is where I will connect to the various devices using butt splices.I would buy this again and recommend it to others for the 2012 JK.,4,Fits well and looks great on Jeep Unlimited 4 door JK - black interior and exterior,1396656000,0,0,Rugged Ridge,Rugged Ridge 17235.58 Black Left Side A-Pillar 4-Switch Pod,17.99

The installation is hard due to jeep not rugged ridge.  The placement of the pillar by Chrysler is extremely tight so you do have to wiggle it in.  The best way i found out how to do it was to remove the snap in panel on the side of the dash and pop the twitter loose from below.  This also allows you to run a wire down.  I would strongly suggest to install a terminal strip below the steering column panel.  The bottom panel closest to the peddle simply pops out and there is a bar there to mount a terminal stirp with can be picked up over amazon or radioshack.  I used 4 daystar rocker switches and used a 8-wire cable from the switches to the terminal strip, this makes the installation a one time deal and not have to take it down every time you add or change a switch.",5,"Factory Color, Factory Fit",1395705600,0,0,Rugged Ridge,Rugged Ridge 17235.58 Black Left Side A-Pillar 4-Switch Pod,17.99

As a woman I know that I am a target for any dishonest repair shop, and not knowing I am familiar with car mechanics they sometimes lie to me about what my car needs.So for that reason alone, I was delighted to get this small but powerful tool.  Now before I take my car in for maintenance I can scan its codes quickly and be prepared for the inevitable news that I need a lot more repairs on my car.  I can smile and drive off and leave them looking confused and puzzled when I don't take the bait.  Not to slam all repair shops but I have run into some heavy duty attempts at conning me into paying for repairs my car doesn't need.I carry this with me in my car, especially on car trips, for those scary times when I'm on the road and the check-engine light comes on.  I also keep the manual in my car so I can diagnose the code by the side of the road and decide if it's safe to keep driving.This just plugs in, and you push the button and read the codes, or lack of them.  It's simple and fast to use.  When I used to buy and sell used cars I could have used this.  The repair manual is complete with hundreds of codes and descriptions for whatever readout you get.  You will need to write down your code when you get it, and compare it with the manual to see what it is indicating.I love how this will also check the emissions control system, and the air conditioning system.On my 2012 Accura the plug is right there under and to the left of the steering wheel. It's not even in the dash or in a compartment, so it's simple to find it and plug this in.  You plug this in while the key is turned so the dash lights come on but the car is not running, to activate the cars electrical system.  This requires no batteries.To test how accurate this is, I dislodged the gas cap and tested my car with this.  Sure enough it gave me the code for a problem with the gas line.  I can promise you this works and is accurate based on my test of it.How they can sell this small computer at this price I have no idea, and the 40 page manual that comes with it is amazing, giving you hundreds of codes and which parts need replacing.

Sure, I've been told that sometimes it is nothing more than reaching a magic number on the odometer or any number of tiny other things, but that engine light is still so vague and yet so terrifying...and that's what the dealership wants. Terror. I called the dealership about my engine light and a &#34;diagnostic reading&#34; was $150 then they could tell me what needed to be done. So that engine light, that may have popped on for nothing more than me crossing some imaginary mile, could cost me $150 for nothing more than to have them to turn it off. And God forbid you just leave it on...try selling a car with the engine light on. Tell your buyer &#34;it is just the mileage indicator&#34;.This plugs right into your car under the dash on the drivers side. A meaningless fault code will appear on the little screen.

The following is my honest opinion.So many of us have been there - you're driving along quite happily and suddenly your dashboard gets a little brighter. As you notice exactly WHICH light came on, it suddenly becomes a burning stare of gloom, an automotive Medusa. Okay, I'm being dramatic, but it seriously makes for a crappy day. A week later, this little guy came in the mail, and following the relatively well-written and simple instructions, I plugged it in and started reading.Turns out my code isn't the end of the world - something to do with one of my fuel system gaskets that is either going to be an $80 or $120 part. But still, unless you have your code read (I know autozone does this for free but I don't have one near me) by a mechanic, you're driving blind, so to speak. Another nifty feature is the code reset. Just for kicks, I reset my codes and hey presto - off goes the CEL. Of course about 50 miles later it was tripped again (if only resetting codes would magically fix the problem) but it's nice to know it works. You can also read your VIN number which is handy, especially if you're buying a used car and want to make sure everything matches up!Overall, this is definitely worth the modest price.

Worse, much worse is that the role of diagnostics and that of repair if vested in the same party can lead to abuse.Put another way, those that deal with customer service and don't even see which mechanic works on the car are gamblers in a losing game.  You can get away with it sometimes but it will catch up with you.  For that reason, people need their own diagnostic tool that can read error codes.  The book that comes with this diagnostic tool tells what the error codes mean.This device is great.  No battery needed - it uses the car's electrical system (without the motor running).  It plugged into my car with no problem.

B00A66OAKE,AEL6CQNQXONBX,This diagnostic fault code scanner tool has proven to be a very valuable tool so far. This scanner connects to the 16 pin connector that is in most newer vehicles. To tell if your vehicle is OBD II compliant and able to be read with this scanner tool then you will either need to locate the 16 pin data link connector if you are familiar with what it looks like or you can check the car or trucks emission control information label. Most of the time the data link connector can easily be found under the dash and it very simple to access. I had no problem locating the connector on my 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally Edition.Our check engine light has been on for years and the dealer has told us that it's nothing to worry about and that it's just something to do with the catalytic converter. They have turned it off several times but it always comes back on. I always wanted one of these scanner tools so I can read the error codes on my own but they were always more money than I was prepared to spend for one. At it's current price this scanner is extremely affordable and I am pretty sure it cost less than any others I have seen so far.This tool seems well made and very durable. The scanner is in a hard plastic case that can take a lot of abuse. The cable is thick and strong as well and about 3 feet long so it's plenty long enough to connect and sit in the car with it in your hands while you use it. The 16 pin connector on the end fits perfectly into the data link connector in my car. It doesn't have any batteries to replace and the LCD screen is back-lit and powered by your car or truck. The screen is bright green and very clear and easy to read.The manual is lengthy but it's very clear and easy to read as well. It contains all of of the definitions that you will need to interpret your fault codes. I did a quick scan of the manual but I could have figured it out without the manual because it's so simple to operate. Simply plug it in and turn your ignition switch to on but don't actually start your car. It will take a minute or two to initialize and read your car's computer. Once it's complete you can go into option 1 and get a list of every fault code that has been recorded. Once you have your codes you can look them up in the manual and find out what the problem is. This function works perfectly.If you go into option 2 then you can delete all of the fault codes that are recorded in your car's computer. I love option because I always had to disconnect the battery for a few minutes in order to clear the computer. You really can't do no harm by deleting the codes because if there is still a problem then they will be recorded again and your service engine soon light will illuminate after several trips in your car. This option works perfectly as well.Option 3 will perform a systems diagnostic and test the operations of the emissions control system. This might be important if you are trying to get your car to pass a emissions test.Option 4 will provide the VIN number if your car or truck is compatible with this function. My car isn't compatible with this option so I am unable to test it.Overall I think this tool is awesome and anyone who works on cars or trucks will appreciate it. It was a welcome addition to my toolbox and one of the most useful tools in my garage.Sample provided for review.,5,"One of the most important tools in my garage.

B00A66OAKE,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,"The DB Power Autel OBD-2 code reader is a small solid basic code reader. The device can read codes, save a snapshot of the codes, and reset the codes - all pretty standard features of a code reader. The control package is rugged, the buttons and LCD have a membrane cover. This is for the backyard mechanic that will do occasional reads, it is not a commercial reader, one that an auto mechanic would use every day. All that said, this is still a solid device with heavy insulation on the wire and good strain relief. For the price, this is extremely well built.The cable is just over two feet long - exactly the right length to plug in the analyzer and sit in the driver's seat. The LCD is backlit with reasonably sized characters. The two buttons have a solid distinct sound when they are pressed.The instruction manual is excellent. There is a long preface about OBD, the abbreviations used, and the caveats for which era of cars will work with the analyzer (the simple answer, if your car is newer than 1988, you can probably read the codes.Using this device couldn't be easier - turn off the car, plug in the connector, turn on the ignition (without starting the car - the battery light will be lit up on the dashboard), press enter on the scanner. There is nothing more to do. When finished, turn off the ignition and unplug the scanner. There's no reason to overcomplicate using this.The OBD connector is easy to find in most newer cars - the Federal government requires the plug be within a short distance of the steering column. Unlike most things in a car, these connectors are in a similar location. You might want a flashlight to find the plug. Sometimes the sockets are covered by a flip down panel.This tool only reads stored codes. It does not do real time reading. It does not read additional data like some of the USB / wireless readers.I tried this on a variety of cars and managed to reset a code on one car. Bottom line - the thing flat out works. I fully expected it to work easily on a 2002 Buick Rendezvous and a 2012 Ford Focus (I was able to read the VIN on both of these cars). I expected the Mercedes to not work at all - I have read that there are odd things about Mercedes that doesn't fit standard. Well in fact it worked perfectly on a 1999 Mercedes E320. Vin number for Mercedes is not supported. There are numerous cautions in the manual about certain compatibility issues with Japanese and European cars - that is for very old cars. Current production cars will have no problems with this analyzer. If your car does not scan - more than likely you had the ignition on before plugging in the meter, or you have the engine running. I did not expect the analyzer to work on a Ford Focus Electric (this is a full battery electric, NOT a hybrid) - it in fact did not work, there is nothing to read on that car, it is zero emissions. The operative thing, with the electric, the tool went through every protocol and then showed an input error and stopped scanning. Exactly as I expected.Resetting codes was super easy. There is a menu setting to erase codes, after pressing enter, there is a Yes / No display. If you press Enter again, all codes are reset. If you press Scroll, the codes are not erased. I like the &#34;are you sure&#34; moment on the display. Yes / No is a weird thing to display - there is no button to press for No. After codes are reset, it will look like nothing happened. I rescanned, and the code remained. In order to see the actual reset or clear in of the code, you need to turn off the car and turn the ignition back on.The manual has a huge list of error codes. I was surprised to find the exact code from a Mercedes. I didn't expect to find that code in the book.This is a reasonably priced reader. For a backyard mechanic that knows which end of a wrench to use, this is a great tool. For the average person, this is probably a needless purchase - unless you understand cars pretty well it is difficult to do anything about those codes. For example - what would you do about a P0938 - Hydraulic Oil Temp Sensor CKT Range/Performance - code? Most of the codes are that cryptic to the average person. The only way the average person saves money with this is if they try to bypass set codes to pass an emission test (if your state requires OBD scan emission tests). If you are really going to repair a Check Engine light, a mechanic already has more sophisticated tools to read the computer, and that will be part of the cost of the repair (he isn't going to reduce the cost of the repair because you tell him the code is P0938, and he might want to check the hydraulic oil system).",5,Rugged Basic Reader,1397347200,1,1,NA,DB POWER&reg; Car Engine Diagnostic Fault Code Reader Scan Scanner Tool OBD2 OBD II MS300,21.99
B00A66OAKE,A2OKRGHIYTBQ6P,"Following the directions in the accompanying manual, I was able to use this device to scan the codes in my car's computer and read my vehicle's VIN. Although the nearby Pep Boys shop will run a FREE scan for me, having a scanner of my own is much more convenient and I can see the results myself without having them &#34;interpreted&#34; by the mechanic.The dealer where I bought my car new won't hook up a scanner for less than $100. This little gadget will certainly save me some bucks because I can identify the problem myself and have a good idea of what kind of repairs may be necessary before I take my car to the shop. If you have detected a problem and have fixed it yourself, you can reset the code that causes your engine light to come on. Not only does it scan the codes on my car, it also scans the codes on my Winnebago Itasca Sunova Model 33C motorhome. This scanner will be accompanying me during my travels in my coach to help us sniff out any troubles that come up.For anybody who wants to know what is going on with his or her car or other compatible vehicle, this scan tool is a reasonably-priced way to become informed.I was provided a free sample of this device in exchange for an honest review, which you have just read.",5,Does What It Claims to Do,1401840000,1,1,NA,DB POWER&reg; Car Engine Diagnostic Fault Code Reader Scan Scanner Tool OBD2 OBD II MS300,21.99
B00A66OAKE,AEC90GPFKLAAW,"Anyone who has driven a car for years has had that panicked feeling when the ""check engine"" light came on.  Is the car going to burst into flames?  Am I permanently damaging the engine by continuing to drive?  Should I pull over and call AAA or just limp home?I've been in that position several times, and then I had to blindly trust the repair guy at the shop when he brought me me the estimate with dollar signs in his eyes.  They charge me $80 for using a diagnostic machine like this one, plus parts and labor for whatever they say is causing the problem.  Even with a shop I mostly trust, I always feel like they push for repairs I don't really need.  I don't like feeling taken advantage of, or having to trust that I really need a new widget for $800.  This fault code reader will save me lots of money by letting ME decide whether the repair needs to be done now or later.This meter works on cars built after 1996, most of which are OBD-II compliant (they use the same type of plug for the meters, and the coding system for errors).  It plugs into an outlet that's found under the dash on the driver's side in most vehicles.  Mine was hanging right there in plain view when I looked under the dash.  You plug the meter in, then turn the ignition to ""on"" but don't start it.  The meter will do the diagnostic and then give you whatever codes it finds.  You can look in the meter's user's manual or online to see what the codes mean.  It's really that simple.On the meter's package, I read something I wouldn't have thought of myself.  If you're thinking of buying a used car, you can use this meter to check the soundness of the engine.  It will show you any hidden engine issues via the stored codes in the car's computer.  Brilliant!I don't have an error code to diagnose right now, but I did plug the meter in on my car so I'd be able to write a knowledgeable review.  I will love going to the repair shop next time and being able to tell THEM what the error code is.  If I know the code has nothing to do with an $800 widget, I won't be taken advantage of.I received a complimentary DB Power Engine Diagnostic Fault Code Reader for testing and review purposes.",5,"Figure out what that ""check engine"" light means before you take your car in for service",1398816000,1,1,NA,DB POWER&reg; Car Engine Diagnostic Fault Code Reader Scan Scanner Tool OBD2 OBD II MS300,21.99
B00A66OAKE,A1PI8VBCXXSGC7,"First off I want to say that theDB POWER Car Engine Diagnostic Fault Code Reader Scan Scanner Tool OBD2 OBD II MS300worked perfectly in our 2009 Malibu.  It  works on OBD-II compliant cars built after 1996 (most of them are OBD-II compliant)  & will retrieve the VIN (Vehicle Identification No) on 2002 and newer vehicles that support Mode 9. When we try it in our 2004 Toyota Sienna & 2006 Civic, I will update my review with the results.One great idea on the packaging suggests you use this to identify any problems with a used car before you buy it.My husband & I were surprised how easy to use this Code Scanner is. The hardest part was getting under the dash to look for the data link connector (DLC). Trying to save my hubby a sore back, I suggested he  do an Internet search to find the DLC location for our Malibu. He decided to look for it first & found it quickly under the dash & centered under the steering wheel. Following the easy-to-understand manual, he hooked it up & continued to follow the step by step instructions. We didn't expect to find anything wrong with our Malibu...and when the scanner's LCD screen didn't show any diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) we knew we were correct. To make sure the scanner was actually working, I decided to check for the VIN number. The VIN number showed up on the screen, so I'd say this code scanner works as promised.I've been told that some car part shops will hook up a scanner for free, but it's nice to have your own. If you're on the road & your car breaks down, this scanner could save you from being ripped off. Also, if you plan on buying a used car, hook this code scanner up to it to check the car for any problems before you buy it.I'll update my review & let you know if it works on  our 2004 Toyota Sienna & our 2006 Honda Civic.No batteries needed.Limited One Year WarrantyUPDATE: 2004 Toyota Sienna...the DLC (it's white)  is located under the dash, slightly to the left of  the steering wheel.

B00A66OAKE,A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,"The Autel MaxiScan OBDII scan tool requires no batteries and is easy to use. First - read the user manual as it is very good. After that, refer to your car's manual to find the location of your car's OBDII port (if you do not know where it is), plug the scanner in, then follow the user manual to use the scanner. This is a good scanner for cars built from 1996 on as cars since then have been required to have an OBDII port.If you lose your manual, one is available for download from various websites (just search for 'Autel MS300 manual') though the link on Autel's website seems to be broken at the moment. Still, a complete pdf copy of the manual was available in several other places.Before I plug the scanner into my car's port, I turn the car on to make sure that all accessories are turned off (radio, a/c, heater, fan, GPS, etc...) and then I turn the car back off. This ensures that there is no unexpected power variance from accessory use while the scanner does its thing. Then, with the engine OFF but your key in the ignition switch:* Plug in the scanner's OBDII cable into your car's OBDII port* Turn the ignition key only to engage the electrical system; do not turn to engage the car's starter* Press the Enter button (blue button on the left) and the unit will begin its scan* Once scanned, press the Scroll button (blue button on right) to see if the scan found any issues* If codes exist, the manual has a very detailed list of scan codes and description for you to reference* Turn the ignition key back to the off position, remove your key and remove the scanner's cable from your car's OBDII portThis scanner does not require any batteries to operate as it works from the power supplied by your car's battery via the OBDII port connection. It communicates with your car's central processing hub which collects information from the electronic control units of the major systems within your car (that is what the 'CAN Protocol' reference is about). However, to use it and to read results from it, the unit needs to be plugged into the OBDII port in your car... so you should keep some paper and pencil handy when using it.Our local dealership charges $80 just to plug their scanner into our car's OBDII and perform this diagnostic, so this Autel MaxiScan will save me that much each time that I need to use it. Additionally, I found the readout's black lettering to be easy to read against the backlit background,The last page of the users manual notes that this Autel MaxiScan device has a one year limited warranty, and that all warranty issues are handled directly with Autel through their website. If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this product gratis from the seller and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed.

Something youdidn't expect to happen. The spray nozzle-tip doesn't &#34;cap-off&#34; shut (as a normal sprayer would),so this means the &#34;slightest&#34; touch or &#34;nudge&#34; of the trigger will set it off & shoot/drip a stream of$$ product.

The sprayer gives a good grip and it's not necessary to hold any part of the bottle when spraying.  I also like the fact that they made the sprayer tube long enough that the intake will stay submerged until the bottle is nearly empty.Properly adjusted the sprayer will produce a fine mist that's optimum for most uses.  You just close the knurled spray adjustment knob and then open it up about 1/8 of an inch.The spray units is indeed a chemically-resistant unit but the bottle is another issue.  It's a #3 PVC plastic bottle and I am not sure it is equal to the task of handling some of the chemicals that one might use for cleaning really difficult areas of the car like baked-on brake dust.

I got the 1st one earlier this week. It was returned the day it was received because one of the 120V wires coming off the main board hasn't attached, it had come off (It was holding on by 1 strand). The replacement came in today, first thing I checked was that wire through the grill slots, it was attached. Plugged it in to my car battery (via the attached clips), powered up just find. Attached a 50w LED work light (50 watts load at the plug, not 50 watts light output), worked just fine. Fan didn't power up. Attached a 175-200 watt load (my Dremel Rotary Tool, it pulls 1.5A (I've tested this with a DMM)) with the LED light. There was a sizable arc inside the unit. It continued to arc, followed quickly by a FIRE and a lot of smoke until I removed the positive terminal of the battery from it. Looked like a fool trying to blow through the fan opening to put it out, then quickly snapped a pic with my phone..unbelievable. This is suppose to have the usual safety circuitry built in , NONE of it worked as designed, it continued to short internally with my battery connected. This is a DANGER to anybody who uses it with high loads.

When we go on a trip with 4 people in the car it isn't unusual to have as many as five of these devices being used, sometimes at the same time. There never seems to be enough charging outlets available. This little device fills the bill for us.We have been using a 140 Watt inverter for a few years already. It has two AC outlets but no USB ports so isn't nearly as handy as this new one. The old one has an internal fan, and a bit of a noisy fan it is. We are all relieved when we turn it off and get rid of that raspy sound. Also that old inverter is about 2"" x 7"" x 5"" so quite large in comparison to this Energizer 120W unit.I tried plugging in my 14"" laptop, and two Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphones and it worked just fine. With no internal fan it is completely quiet.As a few others have said taking up a cup holder isn't very practical unless you have one of those cars with a zillion cup holders. Our two cars only have two cup holders in the front seat, and we use both of them most of the time. So we put this Energizer in the arm rest closed compartment. One concern I have, and I'll have to monitor it, is will this Energizer overheat when placed in the arm rest compartment and put to heavy use.My only complaint is when I actually did have it in a cup holder, and it was night time, the blue light is bright and I could see it's reflection off the two side windows in the front seat so it was a bit distracting. Since we'll be keeping it in the arm rest box it won't be an issue. In other cases when bright LED lights bothered me I put a piece of black electrical tape over the light and just poke a small hole in the tape so I can see the light, which works fine.

B00ATXEIVU,A18HE80910BTZI,"ENERGIZER 120W Cup Inverter is perfect for most needs as long as you are aware of the power output limitations. Remember even-though it has one 120V AC socket does not mean that you can plug anything you want and expect it to run. In my tests I found out that hardware engineers at ENERGIZER has given considerable amount of thoughts with 'safety & protection' in mind when designing this product. In most cases 'over-estimating' the load momentarily causing  the DC & AC outputs to cut-off while in operation. Having said, It does work perfectly when you keep the load on the device well below the limits of 120 watts.Also, as there are no physical ON/OFF switch for this CUP inverter, embedded smart electronics in the device constantly monitors the load & will change the bi-color status LED from Blue to RED indicating overload. I found that the USB ports current draw & the 120 watt inverter share the same 'overload' logic. This can be a problem in some situations wherein the 120v A/C load may draw little bit above the rated limit thereby momentarily shutting off the USB ports. Once the overloading device is removed the unit will automatically start working. While this design keeps the user & device safe during operation it can add some inconvenience inadvertently when the user without knowledge adds a device which overloads the device.PROS[+] Silent Operation[+] Good safety protection[+] Small design with 4 USB ports[+] Includes Battery Clips[+] Smart power draw (Draws power only when load is detected)CONS[-] Bright Blue Light is a distraction while driving.[-] The shape & design of the cup inverter can be problem in some cars as it tends to fall out.[-] The overload circuit is common for both USB and 120v inverter cutting off USB output at times.[-] If you plug-in all four USB ports for charging it would take long time to charge the devices as they are shared.Side-note:Not having a Physical ON/OFF switch is not a deal breaker for me. But worth mentioning as it can be a problem in some cars wherein the cigarette lighter port does not power off when key is removed as it might drain the car battery if left unattended with a large load. Without any load however the device draws negligible current &lt;20mA and can be left connected to the car's cigarette lighter port.I really like this product apart from the limited power of 120 watts.

If you are the type that keeps your car sparkling clean, and waxes it religiously, a &#34;slick&#34; coating of petroleum-based magic (Rain-X is the same thing) over your glass, to help keep it water-stain free and dirt repellant, truly is the icing on the cake. But it definitely takes some time and commitment to get the coating right, with repeated applications. You can actually eliminate the need for using wipers by applying it on your windshield, but, realize that if you decide to start using your wipers, you will get a hazy mess for quite a few strokes. Classic car owners that don't drive in the rain all that often, and have flaky/ineffectual wiper mechanisms, love this stuff.It's also very important to PROPERLY clean all the glass (not just if it's a windscreen you're dealing with) before applying this. Note that polishing your windshield on occasion is a good idea anyway, and is a huge factor in allowing your wipers to work their best. A reasonably cheap electric glass cooktop polish (like Wieman brand) works nicely.When considering this product, you need to ask yourself if it's worth the effort. If you regularly encounter clinging dirt/mud or ice in your travels, it probably is. Because clean up will go much easier. Also, if your car is parked on a highly traffic'd urban street, rinsing the windows with plain water will get them perfectly translucent again, even if it's been parked for a few days.Having clean glass is a safety concern, and so should be a priority.

That takes more elbow grease than indicated and I think too much considering some of the other competitive products out there.

B00AX4TWCA,AP6ZL52YA27W5,"In my mind, there are three leading auto glass 'sealant' treatments out there - Rain-X, Aquapel, and this product, Griot's Glass Sealant.  Aquapel is the most expensive of the three, and as far as i can tell, it is the clear leader in terms of function and longevity.  But for about as much as this 8 oz bottle costs, you get one or possibly two Aquapel applicators, each of which contains just enough solution to treat one windshield or rear window.  But there is no question that Aquapel is pretty miraculous stuff - properly applied, it makes rain skitter across your windshield and fly off into the ozone, and it remains effective for months, even with frequent trips to the local car wash.Griot's Glass Sealant and Rain-X appear to me to be more or less equivalent and second tier.  Both will go on relatively easy.  Both will give your auto glass a clear coating that has moderate water-shedding properties.  Both seem to last a few weeks at most before requiring a new coat.But if you do not mind applying Glass Sealant every few weeks - and it really is not a chore - and if you do not demand the somewhat amazing rain shedding properties of Aquapel, then this reasonably priced 8 ounce bottle of the stuff represents good value for money.  Me, I'm willing to spend the extra coin for the Aquapel treatment.  Here in the Pacific Northwest, it's really nice to be able to cruise along at 30 or 40 mph and watch the rain literally fly off your windshield, driven away by the force of the wind on the glass - you barely need to use your wipers.  Glass Sealant doesn't quite amaze, but it does make your wipers work far more effectively than they do on untreated glass.",4,Does the job,1396915200,0,1,NA,Griot's Garage 11033 Glass Sealant - 8 oz.,10.17

It's not difficult to apply as long as you can easily reach your entire windshield. (I cannot unless I stand on a stool.)Cleaning your window carefully before applying this. We have a surplus of minerals in our water and I was not able to get all the calcium spots off the windshield, even though I cleaned it with a spray glass cleaner followed by wiping with a microfiber cloth. I applied the sealant to the driver's side windshield only, in order to see what difference it made. It broke up the hard water spots so now they are tinier spots but more of them. Still, the overall clarity is improved.When rain hits the windshield, it rolls off faster than it would without the sealant.

B00AX4TWCA,A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9,"I thought that this product would be a pain to use. The instructions are to apply, dry to a haze, buff and repeat the steps.It is easy to apply and buff out so it wasn't bad after all. I did 6 windows on a Honda CRV and by the time I worked my way around the car it was ready to buff.  Then I just worked my way around again. The whole process only took about 20 minutes and I used about 1/5 of the bottle. The windows looked great and I anxiously awaited rain to see how it performed.While I was waiting for the first rain one morning the car had condensation on it and drops had dribbled down the windshield and back window.  I turned on the wipers to clear the window and was shocked to see that the path of the dribbles had etched into the sealant surface and the marks would not go away. I tried using washer fluid and it wouldn't clear it either. Driving into the sun that first day was not pleasant. The marks have faded to the point they are not noticeable anymore, two weeks later they were faint but still there.When the coat of sealant is fresh, about the first week, rain will just slide off the windshield. In a misting rain even the intermittent wipers would not be needed.  When the wipers are used they sweep the rain off cleanly without leaving streaks.  Three weeks after the first application the wipers still clean the windows with no streaks. After 4 weeks the windows need another application.I was ready to write a scathing review after the condensation etching issue but the fact it allows my wipers to do a much better job so long after application has endeared the product to me because no matter how new my wipers were they streak the windshield and of course the streak is always right in front of the driver.My only previous experience with a product like this was with RainX. I hated applying RainX because it was so difficult to buff out and as the coating wears off it caused a terrible chattering from the wiper blades so I quit using it.",4,Easy application and streak free windows for weeks.,1399507200,0,1,NA,Griot's Garage 11033 Glass Sealant - 8 oz.,10.17
B00AX4TWCA,A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM,"OK, I'm a Griot's Garage product fan. I have been using their products for years and have yet to find one that wasn't as good or , in most cases, better than similar products on the market. The same holds true with this glass sealer.Briefly, the idea behind this product is that it seals the glass on your car's windows with a wax-like coating so that rain drops slide easily off as you drive. The first time I used a product like this (Rain-X), I was fascinated by the rain dance the droplets did as they scooted off all of the windows (NOTE: it's not just for the front windscreen!) However, I have noticed that recently, Rain-X has stopped being as effective as it had been (formula change?) so this new offering tempted me.Quick report - it's better than my old faithful Rain-X. But my report is only partially complete because products like this also make getting frost and squished bugs off the glass a lot easier. in NJ, we are in-between frost and bug season so a more &#34;complete&#34; report is not possible. However, it does a darn fine job in rain so I suspect that it will work fine on frost, snow, and bugs.Note - if you have an older car with a rock &#34;peppered&#34; windshield, this and any other similar product the effect won't be as magical. These chemicals seem to like new, smooth glass best. But they will work well on the side and back glass - really something special if you've never tried it.Finally, your windows have to be CLEAN. Really clean. Griot's makes a glass polish that I used in preparation for this test and it makes the glass as clean as you can get it.Drive in rain or snow? Have morning frost or summer bug splatter to clean off? Try this product. It worked for me.",4,"Works well - very similar to ""old"" Rain-X",1398297600,0,1,NA,Griot's Garage 11033 Glass Sealant - 8 oz.,10.17
B00AX4TWCA,AHPV4F8IVSC39,"The primary test of this product is how well it lasts and performs when much of the water on the windshield is sprayed up from the road surface and thus is contaminated with dirt and oil and being rubbed across the windshield by the wipers. I live in a locale where winter is the rainy season and unfortunately this review sample arrived two days after what was likely the last non-trivial rain for many months so I have been unable to do this primary test before this review was due.I use this type of product outside the rainy season because it makes cleaning the windows faster and better. Since I try to park under trees for shade, bird droppings are not just inevitable, but almost immediate. And then there is dust from unending construction in the area. So far, this has been doing an excellent job. For comparative testing I left some window areas untreated -- a strip on the far side of the windshield and on the rear window, and I treated only one of my station wagon's back panel windows. Substantial positive difference.Application was easy. From the instructions, I expected a significant haze to form -- and be buffed out -- but there was a barely perceptible one (not complaining -- it means that there is little product being wasted).The cap on the bottle has two minor problems:First, it pours sloppily. This is not a problem when treating a windshield because you don't need to be precise in wetting the cloth. However, if you want to do a small job, such as the outside mirrors,...Second, that the cap is to be pulled up to open the center hole is not obvious to some -- it takes more force than people expect and the label on the cap is difficult to spot and almost impossible to read (small print, minimal elevation produces negligible contrast in many lighting conditions). Consequently, some may treat it as a cap to be unscrewed.--- Douglas B.

There are several different opinions on what is best to use for applying, and I'm not qualified to make that call, so you'll have to ask someone else that.  But at the very least, plan on having a bag of lint-free towels.You have to apply the product in a ""cross-hatch"" pattern, let it dry to a haze, apply it again, let it dry to haze again, then buff it thoroughly till it's crystal clear all over.  If you wax your car regularly, this might seem like no big deal (and you're going to love this stuff, and you probably already use something like this, so I'm wasting your time here).  But if you're not much of one for detailing your car, this is going to seem like a lot of work.However, one you get it on properly, it really does work well.

In winter, you can have sleet, snow, ice, and rain... in the spring it is rain and pollen. Summer brings us downpour storms and bird droppings.  Each of these create their own challenges for drivers trying to keep a clean windshield and good visibility.  Griot's Glass Sealant addresses them all.Water just beads right off the glass - whether is is a mild drizzle or a severe thunderstorm.  You will find that you seldom need to even use your wipers, and when you do employ them it is like they are on steroids, leaving a like-new glass surface with each swipe. Cleaning the windshield is also much easier.  Whether doing your weekly (or monthly) washing, or trying to remove that huge splatter that a passing bird just deposited in your field of view - the treated glass cleans effortlessly and completely.The product is easy to apply: ensure you glass is clean and dry, and then using a foam or terry applicator just apply it in vertical and horizontal wipes, to ensure full coverage. The sealant will glaze over and give the glass a fogged look.  Make sure you didn't miss any spots, and then just buff it until it is clear. This is easy and does not take incredible force.I have found the Glass Sealant to last much longer than I expected it to. Depending on the time of year, and what it has to deal with in terms of weather, it can last a couple of months and remain very effective. Your wipers will last longer for two reasons - first because you are using them less; and second because when you do use them, they are gliding over a smooth treated surface with less friction.  This prevents the rubber blade from wearing as it normally would.The Griot's Glass Sealant is a staple in my garage, and something I automatically reorder when the bottle gets low.

B00AX4TWCA,A1MCH5RXDOH87H,"I've used the 'other' windshield sealing product for decades. I bought it when it was an infomercial special. Once I got it applied right I was amazed at how it improved driving in almost every wet weather situation. Light mist being the one thing these products don't handle well. So I was happy to try the Griot's Garage version when it was offered.Application was easy. One small towel wet with the product applied in a crosshatch pattern on the windows. Wait a few minutes for that coat to dry and apply a second coat. Then buff off with another, clean, towel. Just about the same as the 'other' product except I used to use a wet method of buffing off theirs and Griot's only mentions using a dry towel to remove the haze that forms when you apply this.I must say that the Griot's Garage window sealant buffed off much easier than Rain-X (there, I said it) ever did. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Does it buff off so easily because it's leaving less product applied to the window or is it just formulated better? Or was the wet method I used to use just that bad at getting the job done? I really can't say at this point.Fortunately just a day or two after applying this the Florida weather kicked up several hours of serious downpours while I was out. I was even test driving a new Kia in the middle of the storms and really wished I had been back in my car when the rain got heavy.This stuff works. Just as well as Rain-X (I said it again) ever did. Rain water beads up and at speeds over 30mph or so just shoot right the heck off the windshield. At slower speeds they quickly slide down the glass. I usually get one rainy season out of a coating on my car. I'm driving a bit more than I have in the past years so I'm sure this will be put to the test frequently. When it starts to wear off and needs another application I'll come back and update this review.Things I wanted to note:The bottle works differently; lift the cap so the dimple that seals it is lowered inside the cap. I found that no matter what I did product leaked out from around the bottom lip of the cap you lift up to dispense the sealer. I probably wasted a  more product than I used due to this leakage.This product, compared to Rain-X is expensive (yes, I received this for free but I made myself aware of the price to provide a comprehensive review) in fact it's several times more expensive than the old style flip-top Rain-X product that is still available. Griot's clear bottle lets you see easier when you're running low but I can't detect any real difference between the two products, they smell and apply exactly the same.

Although the Griot's Glass Sealant does help rainwater bead on the windshield, the beads are large, and don't easily move themselves out of the field of view. Rain-X, on the other hand, creates a myriad of extremely tiny rainwater beads that all immediately migrate off the windshield, making it unnecessary to even turn on the windshield wipers at highway speeds.We did notice e Griot's Glass Sealant helped smooth and quiet the motion of the windshield wipers during rain, but there was no chance of leaving the wipers off even in a light mist.I wonder if perhaps this Griot's product might be better suited for folks wanting a show car windshield to look its absolute best, as opposed to someone like me just looking for an equivalent of Rain-X.",2,"Helps, but sure isn't rain-x",1396656000,0,1,NA,Griot's Garage 11033 Glass Sealant - 8 oz.,10.17

I have used Rain-X in the past but can't say I was all that impressed.The sealant is applied easily using a dry cloth (I used a microfiber one) after first cleaning the windshield.  Even though I thought I got the windshield very clean, the sealant removed some dirt I missed.  Griot's recommends applying a coat, letting it dry to a haze, and then apply a second coat and let it dry to a haze before polishing it off.  I applied the sealant liberally and still had a lot left after using it on only my windshield.  It dries to a light haze very quickly and polishes to a very clear shine with minimal effort.Rain beads up and runs off the windshield after using the sealant.  It's almost a Star Wars effect to watch the rain beads fly upward off the windshield while driving down the road.  In light rain I don't even have to turn on my windshield wipers.

Received the second pair and inspected. The first one was perfect. The only one with a lens that was fully seated. Opened the second one only to find the lens at least 1/4 inch from seated in the housing. Just returned both. I'll try another style.I will admit the one I tested put out a strong beam and the price is cheap but the quality was too cheap for me to keep. I will agree with other reviews about the crappy bracket. The provided screws bottom out on the light housing before clamping the bracket to the housing. Also other reviews have mentioned about moisture in the light. I could definitely see this with the crappy way the lens is glued into the housing. This could be cured by adding sealer around the edge.

B00AZPP0Y6,A393MV5JXZF5AP,"Very nice LED work light.  My 2012 Jeep JK has no decent rear light to allow you to store your cargo when it is dark. I had purchased this light to mount on a spare tire light mount but the plate on the mount is too small for this light. I am needing to decide now whether to mount it in a different spot (not many other places to do so since I have a soft top) or find a larger plate to mount on top of the light mount.This is a separate issue not related to the quality of the light. It is a hefty light made of a combination of plastic and metal. The mounting arms are metal with rubber pads which may be a good thing and will help to dampen some of the vibration and keep it from being transferred to the light. The part of the mounting arm that contacts the light body is grooved as is the light body. This ensures that the direction that you point it in will stay fixed.The only disappointment that I have with the light is that the power cable that runs from it is only 12-14 inches long. So you either need to connect it to a terminal block, a switch or use some butt splices. I would recommend against butt splices because that creates a weak spot in the link. And depending on where you mount it there may be no place to locate a terminal block. I will probably mount a switch, because even though I will have a switch in the cab to turn it on it will probably be nice to have one by the light itself. I guess another option might be to take the unit apart depending on how you feel about invalidating your warranty.",5,Very nice LED worklight,1405036800,0,0,Generic,36w LED Spot Work Light,28.5

If you let your pads sit long enough for all the compound to cure inside the pad, a pre-soak is necessary and this cleaner does a good job. FWIW, you shouldn't let your pads get to that point anyways.As I said this gives you one of everything.Yellow - Heavy Cut & Levelling pad, for use with heavy cut compounds for severely damaged surfaces.Orange - Medium Cut & Heavy Polishing pad, for use with medium compounds & one-step products on damaged surfaces.White - Light Cut and general purpose polishing pad. This is probably the most versatile and well-used on good/decent paint.Blue - Pure polishing pad for use with All-in-One cleaners and glazes, will remove light imperfections and is a really good glazing pad.Black - Extra Fine finishing pad, use this with glazes and all-in-one cleaners on black/dark paint, or paint that's in extremely good shape and/or new. I personally like using this with glazes on new paint that have a sealant built in, or for use with pure sealants and cleaner-waxes.Red - This is the finest of them all, used for the very final application of wax and/or sealants. You can use it for glazes, too - but those will be more effective using the blue or black pads.And finally, the green pad - a cross between white and orange. This pad is extremely versitile and is a great all-around pad for less-than-perfect finishes. I wouldn't use this for final polishing out a black car, but it has the ability to polish out oxidation without cutting, like the orange pad.

Darn nice truck too, but like a lot of other reviewers on here, it is full of gaps around the seat and the console that swallow up everything dropped down and about there like a black hole.  The result is well known by everyone that has experienced this with their keys, money, cell phone, etc...You on your knees scrounging around down below spewing more than a few cuss words along the way...Anyway, I teased my wife over the years that when the time comes I had dropped something down there for the 500th time, I would find a solution to the problem.  Lo and behold, I figure that the 500th incident just passed on by recently and I declared that event an end to any time on my knees.. (Bypassing naughty words in such incidents will take a might more work).  I also figured that somewhere along the way someone else much more innovative than me had to go beyond being ticked off, and done something constructive about it.

B00C5THYIK,AJCHGS1GND4OA,"I wanted to wait until I had a change to use this controller towing a heavy load before writing a review. I had that chance this past weekend.I have a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the Eco Diesel and I used it to tow a load of 7000lbs for about a 6 hour ride. The trailer brakes, and controller, worked flawlessly. The controller was easy to set and it worked very proportionally. The brake application was very linear.That doesn't mean everything is perfect. From an operational standpoint I am very happy. The installation itself wasn't bad either. My only issue is with the remote display and remote manual brake control unit. Both are larger than I would have liked and that is especially the case with the manual brake control. In trying to find a spot for the both of them their size caused some issues. It's not that they are so large they won't fit places, it's that they are large enough that it is difficult to make them inconspicuous when installed and not in use.With the display once the rubber bezel and pivoting mount is removed it is much better. It would have been nice though it had much less depth. To the point of being able to have the back of the unit stuck to a flat surface facing the driver. It is deep enough that about the only real choice is to mount it on the top of the dash somewhere. I wound up placing it on the dash top just in front of the A pillar. When not in use it is a little more noticeable than I'd like but not terrible. Also, without the ball mount, being just Velcroed to the dash top, it is not perfectly angled to the driver. Using the ball mount you can angle it any way you'd like but for me the ball mount was far too bulky. In the end it works.For the manual brake control it is far more bulky and thus harder to find an inconspicuous place for it. Ultimately I mounted it to the knee bolster very as low and to the outside of the drivers compartment as possible. It is quite large. I'd have preferred it to be at least 1/2 its size.The whole idea of having the three parts of this setup separate instead of a single unit is to allow flexible and &#34;custom&#34; installation. When you take their bulkiness and then add in somewhat substantial cables, it makes a true lay custom or integrated look very difficult.Even with these difficulties I am giving this item 5 stars, just barely though. The reason is, it is still better than a standard brake controller for reduced bulk and it works very well. Just be prepared to take some time to get it installed in a manner you would like and keep in mind it will be very hard to get a truely integrated look.",5,"Works well, but...",1394668800,3,3,Hopkins,Hopkins 47297 INSIGHT Brake Control,120.55

B00C5THYIK,A23ONMGKEWDG4M,"This review is somewhat delayed.  The unit comes with a generic cable used to attach it to the vehicles braking system and power.  This cable is for use with a vehicle that does NOT come with a ""Factory Equipped Trailer Tow Package"".  This is understandable as there must be a zillion different sizes and shapes of tow vehicles.  My vehicle, a Chev 2500 diesel, did come with a towing package.  Consequently I have ordered the correct cable from Hopkins.  Once it arrives, should be a simple process to hook it up and test the braking system.Present observations:Units, there are 3 pieces, look well made.  The display itself is smaller then I expected,  about inch high and a tad wider.The cables will for sure be long enough for just about any placement of the three units. (Control box, display and manual brake control)  They appear to be heavy enough without being stiff so can be routed easily.I'll update this review when the ""Tow Package"" cable ($7 additional) arrives and is units are installed and tested.UPDATE:  Using the cable Hopkins sent for my vehicle, installation was a 10 minute job.THE UP-SIDE:The cables for the various pieces/parts were long enough, flexible and sturdy.I was easily able to place the LED display, the manual brake control and control box for easy visibility and access.After setup, braking was good.  Worked very well towing my 30 foot double axle travel trailer.THE DOWN SIDE:The LED display is smaller than need be.  It's also not bright enough to be really useful in the sunlight.Unlike my Tekonsha brake controller (which I've reconnected and am using again) the Hopkins unit apparently releases the trailer brakes when at a full stop even though the tow vehicle brakes are activated.  At least the display reverted to zero at each full stop.The display and manual stop units have no provision to permanently  attach them anywhere.  Yes, you might use double sticky tape but that's a temporary measure especially when the truck may get to be 140 degrees inside after sitting all day in 100 degree sunlight.Conclusion:  Hopkins has a great idea here if some minor improvements are made.  A larger,brighter display.  Partial brakes at full stop.  Ways to hard attached all the units.",4,Does the job but could use some improvements,1399680000,2,2,Hopkins,Hopkins 47297 INSIGHT Brake Control,120.55

For my car there is no ground shadow which is great.Cons: The bulb (H11) isn't the L-type.  So if you don't have a lot of room between the end and the dust-cap you may run into issues.  The signal canceler/capacitors are very poorly protected.  This is a capacitor! water shouldn't get in there.  Just because they are installed under the hood, there is no guarantee that the water won't splash inside (for any reason).  They are practically just a capacitor with shrink-wrap around them!!!!Over all i'm happy with them so far. i will try to go for a night drive to see how they differ from the 6000 35w ones.

Light is crisp white on the road but when looking directly at the headlights, there is a beautiful tinge of blue. During the install, I only installed one capacitor on the passenger side light because I recycled the old relay harness from my old 35watt vvme kit which only utilizes one connection to the OEM harness directly to the ballast and the capacitors can only be used when connecting the OEM harness to the ballast. The other OEM connection on the driver's side is just taped off and tucked away.

I thought this product would be helpful in keeping my newly painted hood in pristine condition. We followed the directions as directed and watched several videos over and over again because I did not want to make any mistakes. After the hood was pelted with snow, sleet and salt from the roads my hood looked cloudy and it looked like it had cracks. I was extremely disappointed. I was so upset because it worried me if my hood would even come back to its original condition before the 3M Paint Defender was applied.To remove this stuff was not an easy task. My husband ended up wet sanding the hood and then buffing it back to a high shine. I will never consider using this again. I might think about the ""clear bra film"" option, which is done by professionals and is said to last 5 to 7ears. The clear bra is more of a ""saranwrap"" fitted hard film instead of spraying on a finish on your car.

B00CCOBOI4,A2HMF8ZR67BNZS,"First let me very clear about this review. I did not do a good job as the instructions clearly stated you should apply at temperatures between 65 degrees and 90 degrees. Well folks it is winter time and we have had a lot of freezing temperatures and from the immediate forecast it is not likely to hit the 70s  or higher anyway soon. Thus when I got a short break I tried the spray out on the front of my Jeep. Just a small area. I used the wax provided in the kit. I did not apply in direct sunlight and the Jeep&#8217;s engine was cold, thus the front end and hood were also cold.I mask a section of the front end off as suggested in the instructions. I them applied the wax which was provided. Using the Paint Defender Spray Trigger I applied the film to the waxed area. I used three coats and applied per the instructions on the pamphlet. While the front was still wet I removed the masking tape. By this time the temperature was falling. I still let the car sit in the available sun. I found it still a little sticky to the touch. The instructions indicated it should be dry to touch.I have not had the film on the car for several days thus I am not sure how well the cure is going to be. It appears that I do have a thin film over that section of the hood and that is the section most likely to hit by sand or road debris.Bottom line is that I spent quite some time, reading the instructions, prepping the small area and spraying the area. It may be worth all the work involved however I think I will personally pass on doing this again. The product seems to do what it says it will do, just be prepared for some of your time. I am pleased with the section I prepared. Suggest you view the videos shown on the site as they are rather good.I am going to give this four stars since the product did do what it promised however the work involved is just too much for me.",4,Looks Good and so far it is working,1389916800,0,0,NA,3M 90100 Paint Defender System,34.99

I didn't apply on the hood.My experience is that the online video instructions were sufficient.  Still, because I was spraying on a more vertical than horizontal surface, the amount of material to apply wasn't intuitive to me.  Too much and I'd get little streaks.  Too little and I'd have to re-tape and reapply.  Because of this I opted to apply two coats and then touch small areas.The finished product is a bit remarkable.  It seems like strong stuff, and an actual film that looks normal.  However, I'd prefer to take this to an experienced crew that can efficiently knock it out.  For those that are extra handy though, this is a great product.To compare with the 3M Clear Bra, the expertise required is substantially different.  I would not try applying 3M Clear Bra unless you can afford to waste some material while training.

On my new Accord, I was especially paranoid about any kind of damage, so being able to review this product was quite a blessing.  Normally I don't get much in the way of stray rocks in intercity driving but when I venture out of state on roads that are filled with open areas, flying rocks aren't uncommon.First off, when you get this it's very intimidating if you aren't used to body work.  There's a huge plastic sheet you mask your car off with, which will require a bit of studying if it's your first time.  But remember, you're only applying a plastic sheathing on your paint, not paint itself, so use that thought to relax yourself.  Ensure you only do this job inside a garage whereby wind wont get in the way.The recommendation is to ensure you have a good wax job before you start, as this helps remove the layer easily later on.  Obviously, you want to ensure the car's areas to be applied are very clean as well.  You then following the directions and spray the application on.  I would suggest you start somewhere less visible at eye level so you can &#34;practice&#34;  - the lower bumper perhaps.  Pretty straight forward until you realize that you probably don't have enough in the can to apply everywhere you want so plan this ahead of time !Once dried, it is visible for sure.  But, it's much less obvious than those old car bra's you probably dealt with before.  Question is, does it last ?  I cannot comment because I have not taken the car out of state yet.

Then, once the finish is on, it makes my shiny black car look like it is covered with gray film - not at all what I wanted.

I just bought a car, and I'm definitely going to apply it to the bra-area.My only drawback:  It doesn't go very far.  If you have more than a small bra area, you'll need two cans.I ended up applying two coats to my motorcycle, as I do custom Swarovski work atop the clear vinyl and I wanted to have the extra protection.  I called 3M before I did it, and while they had no real warnings against it, it wasn't something they'd field tested.  My 3M vinyl supplier said that he'd worry that it'd bubble.  It didn't.  It actually is awesome.  I can tell that the paint is protected, and the fact that it's so easily removed is a big plus.The warranty only lasts for one year, but I suspect that, if taken care of, it will last much longer.Note--do not wash this until you've put a coat of the wax atop of it.

This ensures that the protectant dries and cures into a tough and tear-resistant film that peels off clean when it comes time to remove it.

Well, here's my assessment. It could be a good thing IF, and that's a very big IF, you wax first, then mask everything right. then spray perfectly, then let it dry (2 days at least!) then wax again.

B00CCOBOI4,A2JP9E1H0SF392,"This product reminds me of Plasti-Dip and clear bra vinyl combined.  It is made to provide a clear, waxable surface coat to protect your paint.  It supposedly lasts a year and is fully removable by peeling it off.  For me, the best places to apply are front bumper and front leading edge of the hood.  Bare in mind that a can of the stuff doesn't cover much.  A full hood is 2 cans.  The leading edge of the hood is about 1 can.  The front bumper is 1 can.  The kit includes some wax to apply after you clean the surface--this is to make removal easier.  Applying the spray is pretty easy after you mask off areas adjacent to where you are spraying (plastic sheeting and tape included).  The spray is thicker than spray paint and is self-leveling, making it easy to apply.  Don't be worried that the spray is milky opaque at first--it will dry into a nice shiny clear surface.  The spray will cure in a few hours but is rain fast after a few days.Because of the prep and cure/rainfast times, I would recommend this for dedicated car enthusiasts.  It certainly is not as simple as cleaning and waxing your car.  So far, I can confirm that the Defender leaves a thin, uniform surface that is clear and shiny.

I'm familiar with the 3M clear bra system from professionals and it is very, very good but expensive.

Not just wash the car but wash, clay, machine clean, polish (but NOT wax) and make sure it is absolutely baby butt smooth and that there is no dirt or debris residing on the surface.  However, even after doing all this, I still had dust on the surface by time I masked off the rest of the front end.  So my first attempt was way less then perfect so I thought I'll just peel it off and try again - wrong!  The easy peel nature of this product is a fiction - it's a mess to remove and will try your patience.I threw the rest of the product away and figured if I really wanted the protection, I'd go to the professionals and pay $300 for a 3M clear bra treatment which I understand is very, very good and very durable.

B00CCOBOI4,A4D5B7Q8A7PA6,"There's a long checklist of things you should do before evening buying this item. I'll go through some but do urge stringent research before committing to this product way over and above my review.1) Do you even need protection? Put a few thousand miles on the car per year or the paint is already chipped. Then the answer is probably no.2) Is it worth the massive extra expense of going for a professional solution foregoing one at this price point? If your car is worth fifty grand plus then I would say so.3) Are you prepared for a more matte, cloudy finish on the front of your car? If not then no clear bra solution is for you and you should look for something else.4) Are you experienced with spray painting, do you know how much or how little to apply? If not then this shouldn't be your first attempt.5) Were you aware that this is a temporary solution that requires almost yearly attention? If not are you okay with that?6)Arre you able to let the product acclimatize in fair temperature of 65 or so then work at that temp? Too hot it won't work, too cold it really won't work.Okay with that out of the way the reason I mention all this is due to the current negative reviews. It isn't for motorcycles, it isn't for all over body protection, it WILL dull the area it is protecting, it requires a nice temp to use, it helps if you're comfortable with spraying, prep work done right is essential etc. You can't just shake the can and get going.I applied this, based on the above points, to my recent Yaris's front bumper and tiny hood. And you know it looks great, it works great and I'm happy that on a car worth less than ten grand I didn't have to outlay five hundred plus on professional stuff nor did I have to settle for a plastic black bra. My car looks great and is very well protected which for the price is no bad thing.Yes, I could point a finger at 3M for seemingly over-stressing the simplicity but some personal responsibility must also be applied, especially those here who attempted to do this in extremely low temperatures due to the time of year.Please go in prepared to work before your purchase and work during the installation. Follow the manufacturer's rules and be patient. Read up on other's experiences and set a few hours aside.

The second con (and reason for only 3 stars) is that the bottom of the pad looks like it would grip, but is just as slippery as a clean piece of plastic.

I just did my entire second car with this towel and never had to wring it out all the time like I have to with chamois.  And I am very particular with my cars.  This product is excellent.  No swirls, scratches, etc...........  It just absorbs all the rinse water after a wash.  We just bought 2 new 2014 cars with Xzilon coating that I also like much.  Xzilon recommends chamois but this towel is better than the chamois which are very expensive.  This product should get a 6 rating.  This towel cut my drying time in half.  Makes me want to wash my cars more often.****** I am so impressed with this towel that I bought a 3rd one.  Just did my wife's car (Outback) again and one towel did it all.  Yes it does snag a bit, but that should be expected when going around sharp corners or emblems.  This time I was more careful and no snags.  It was perfect.  I just dampened the towel around the sharp corners.  Still cut my drying time in half if not more.

B00D010TDY,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,"I've been using the Griot's Garage brand leather cleaner for years to clean the leather seats in my car. Although that has worked very well, this has impressed me enough to become my regular cleaner.The cleaner is on the thick side, which is a big plus for me. My one complaint with the Griot's cleaner was that it was thin and runny, making it difficult to do vertical surfaces without creating a bit of a mess. This cleaner clings well to both the cleaning cloth (I used a microfiber cloth) and the surface being cleaned.It spreads easily and does an excellent job of cleaning. I was able to get out some ground-in dirt along the base of the seat and the trim areas from dirty shoes (winter time gunk is in full force!). Lifted out the dirt without any fuss.I'm also very pleased with the shine it leaves behind after buffing. It's a very ""natural"" looking shine, and leaves the seat soft and smooth.It has virtually zero scent. That's a plus most of the time, but I have to say that I sort of miss the scent of the Griot's cleaner a little bit since it had a great ""new car"" smell.Although it's about the same price as the Griot's brand, in comparison with ""common brand"" leather cleaners (such as Mothers and other similar brands) it is a bit pricey. But since just a little of this goes a long way, plus the fact that it works so well, I would consider it to be a good value.Highly recommend![Sample provided for review]",5,Excellent results on car seats; beats Griot's Garage cleaners,1388880000,1,1,NA,"Leather Cleaner &amp; Conditioner by Vital Brandz for Boots, Furniture, Car Interiors, Jackets, Purses, White Leather and More.

B00D010TDY,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,"I was mainly interested in using the Premium Leather Cleaner & Conditioner for my Merrells.  I wear them a lot and figured they needed a bit of a pick-me-up and had been using Scotchgard Shoe Guard.  Now the Scotchgard works nicely as a pick-me-up, but doesn't really condition the shoes. They were starting to show their age a tad, but needed a little something extra to really bring them back to life, not just polish them up.I also applied them to an old, worn pair of leather shoes as shown in the video.  The Premium Leather Cleaner & Conditioner really brought them back to life, paint specks and all.  It is a creamy whitish formula that I simply used a soft cloth to apply.  When I did this, with both my Merrells and the old pair of shoes, a considerable amount of dirt was removed at the same time.  I did not have to clean the shoes prior to polishing because this formula managed to do it for me.FEATURES:&#9658;  Easy to Use&#9658;  Can also be used on Vinyls&#9658;  Can be buffed to a soft luster&#9658;  Retards water spotting&#9658;  Contains no solvents or harsh chemicals&#9658;  Proudly made in the USAThe Merrills really looked like new, save for the creases I've generated from walking.  Stepping back from the old pair of shoes and looking at them, it's hard to tell that they are as old as they are.  The fact that they are resists soiling and retards waterspotting is a real plus.  The type of leather these shoes have is not likely to absorb water readily, but I do appreciate that added protection.  I would not use this on suede, nubuck, or textured leather because it simply absorbs the polish and darkens the leather considerably, something you may not like.Sample provided for review.",5,Excellent product to clean and condition your leather products ...,1388793600,0,0,NA,"Leather Cleaner &amp; Conditioner by Vital Brandz for Boots, Furniture, Car Interiors, Jackets, Purses, White Leather and More.

B00D010TDY,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,"I used the Vital Brandz leather cleaner and conditioner on our two vehicles: my wife's pickup truck and my SUV. Neither vehicle has any leather, but the SUV has a vinyl dashboard and door panels, and the pickup truck has vinyl and plastic door panels. The pickup truck is 18 years old and has not had a thorough interior cleaning in some time, so the door panels were pretty filthy with ground in dirt and oils. Using a clean rag, the leather cleaner was remarkably effective in removing the dirt, and after some buffing, it looked great - maybe not like new, but very much improved. On the plastic section of the door panel, the leather cleaner was not as effective in removing dirt, however.On my SUV, the dashboard was pretty clean, but a little light buffing after wiping on some of the leather cleaner shined it up nicely. I've used several cleaning and protective products over the years, and the Vital Brands cleaner and conditioner appears to be as effective as any of them on vinyl interiors. I'll be interested in using the product again in a few months when the sun and the scorching summer temperatures take their toll on a car's interior finishes.For now, though, I'm pleased with the product.

Both the stains on the chair, and the streaks of ground in dirt on the seats in my truck cleaned up very quickly.  This stuff worked very well at really getting out the stains and dirt without a lot of hard scrubbing, and the smell of it is not offensive at all.  And I had no adverse results from it as to darkening or residue. One thing I would suggest with this is that you pay attention to the notes in the product description as to using it.  The directions on the bottle are minimal, and in the description here much more detailed.  Also, I really had the best results with this using a piece of cheesecloth, rather than some old rag.

I was highly skeptical. Cheap blades are $10 and last six months. These are a little under $20 and last over a year without any significant loss in performance. And they're compatible with the RainX washer fluid to boot (won't turn orange or degrade).I had to knock off a star because every set of these for me will chatter and wiggle near the edges on occasion. It's because the blade isn't rigid enough. RainX needs to improve the design to increase lateral rigidity so that this doesn't happen. Out of the box, the rainx isn't as good as a regular blade.

I knew what to do with the restorer, but then was a bit confused on which product came next, the polish or the wax.  There's really nothing in the package that tells you which one to end with, so I picked the polish.  Either way, it did a good job on my running lights as well as all other parts, but they were the biggest surprise.  They were extremely hazy and cloudy and the restorer made them almost like new. Once I put the wax on them, they looked really good. I was impressed. I'm going to use this product on my car's fenders which are fiberglass as well and see if they get back in shape. This is definitely worth the money, but they need more complete instructions or at least put big numbers on the containers.  Three stars!",3,"Good Product, Needs More Complete Instructions",1402531200,0,0,NA,Meguiar's M4966 Complete Marine/RV Fiberglass Restoration Kit,43.63
B00D8XCMMA,A14JBDSWKPKTZA,"Many boats that are made of fiberglass have a coat of paint on them. Generally speaking the more expensive the boat, the more pure colored fiberglass you will see. Why am I mentioning this? Because the heavy duty oxidation remover in this kit is designed for rock hard fiberglass, and not for paint. It is a bit aggressive for paint unless it is super oxidized, and needs a layer removed. This level of scrub is not designed to give you polish or gloss, but rather to remove the surface oxidation. So that is why they provide three different formulas. This kit includes: Meguiar's heavy duty oxidation remover (M4916), boat/RV polish (M4516) and gloss enhancer, boat/RV pure wax (M5616), soft foam applicator pads - 3PK (X3070), microfiber towels - 3PK (X2020), mirror glaze apron.The polisher is to be used as a second step, and finally use the wax to preserve your work underneath. I had a high end body shop for 20 years, and when I was younger I did a lot of hand rubbing in the driveway. It is a lot of work. Full blown professional polishers are for people who know how to run them. Why do I say that? Because it is necessary to learn how to let the spinning wheel scoot off the edge of a plane, rather than doing the opposite and having the wheel dig into an edge, or should I say catch an edge and burn through it. On a car if you are not careful you could destroy an antennae, or a rear view mirror. I mention buffers because they do a lot more work, a lot faster. Also using lamb&#8217;s wool tie on bonnets, on top of the cutting bonnet gives you mirror like results.There are gentler use buffers out there designed for polishing. The PORTER-CABLE 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher is the number one seller here at Amazon and is tamer than the Makita 9227CX3 7-Inch Hook and Loop Electronic Polisher-Sander with Polishing Kit which is more than twice the power of the Porter Cable. It also takes full sized standard in the industry buffing pads/wheels. If you really want to tread lightly while experiencing less elbow grease you can opt for the WEN 10PMC 10-Inch Waxer/Polisher in Case with Extra Bonnets. The WEN is actually one tenth of the power of the Makita and one fifth the power of the Porter Cable.So anyhow the points I want to make are these. This kit is for fiberglass, not paint, and a lot of boats have a top coat of paint. Hand rubbing is an enormous chore, and if you have a larger boat, at the least you should invest in the Wen mentioned above, or better yet the Porter Cable while exercising some caution. Only if you have a deep desire to master a polisher over time, or are already an accomplished polisher do you need to think about the Makita. I could write a book on polishing techniques, and if you use the Makita on your car, with just one wrong angle on an edge you can burn the finish right down to the primer.Do you have to have a polisher? No because hand rubbing will do a nice job. Polishers have the capability of giving you higher gloss, and deeper depth of fresh glass for better colors. Some people fine paper older glass using wet or dry paper like 1,000 grit, and then use compounds to remove the fine scratches. My philosophy is don't go deeper than you need to.Hand rubbing with this kit will give you very nice results on fiberglass. Save yourself a lot of work, and at least get the Wen. I recommend the Porter Cable for those who are willing to practice and get good at an entry level buffer. By the way do not use this kit, or any polish in the direct sunlight which can take polish residue and bake it into a hard line in no time that is a pain to remove.Meguiar's has been one of my favorites for over 30 years.

So, depending on the surface area of gel coat you need to work on, it should last a while.  I don't know for sure, but I expect the wax would be useable on auto finishes, since it is carnauba wax.  But, you may want to ask Meguiar's before you use it for that - I tried calling their customer service number to ask and gave up on waiting to get through.  Was tempted to knock off a star for that, but I expect most people wouldn't really care about that.  My boat is small, so I might like to use the wax on a car, but I'm not yet sure if it's OK.

It took his looking through a 10X loupe to see the threads running through the fabric to agree with me.  The point is these chamois are working better than the real thing from my standpoint and after using both, I would not revert to the old ways.They maintain moisture for quite some time and are ready to go to work right out of the container.

I washed all the windows on my house, inside and out, and used the chamois to dry them. They were lint free and streak free - and look so much better than they did when I used a squeegee and a towel. Clean-up was simple. I just rinsed out the chamois, wrung out the excess water, rolled it up damp and put it back in its plastic case.

With one dual-light spotlight in front yard and one single-light spotlight in the backyard, most of the yard was dark. Having built a patio out back last year, one of my priorities was fixing the lighting situation. I put one solar spotlight on the patio, but the other side of the backyard still need something. I opted for the Sunforce 82080 80-LED Solar Motion Light.With this light, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about running electrical to that side of the house, which made installation a lot easier. I also like that the solar feature means this light won&#8217;t add to my electric bill.I don&#8217;t have a drill that goes into brick, so my neighbor helped me install it using his drill. He installed the solar panel on the end of the house that gets full sun all day, and put the light itself around the corner where it could light up half the backyard. The long cable between the solar panel and the light means you can put the solar panel someplace different than the light if the light is to be hung in a shady area.We had some burglaries in our neighborhood a few months ago, and so one of the things that drew me to this light was the motion detection feature. My hope is that if the light comes on, it may deter a burglar if they think they can be spotted easier. Also, if someone is creeping around the house, there is a better chance one of my neighbors might notice if the area is lit up. The light goes off when no motion is detected, and comes on for several minutes when it does sense motion.You can adjust the time duration and the motion detection range to whatever your preference is.This light has served well since I installed it.

B00FDQPCR2,A28TWWUAWFVCTR,"I've been using the 60 LED version of this light for nearly a year.  The 80 LED light is virtually identical, other than being brighter because of the extra 20 lights.  When you first get your light the battery is powered, but I recommend you follow the directions and let it charge for several days with the light switch in the off position to fully charge.  There are 3 settings to customize the light to your needs.  One sets the length of time the light will stay on when triggered. Another sets the sensitivity- or the distance at which movement is detected to trigger the light.  The third determines if the light will come on at dusk, dull daylight or if it will only come on if it's pitch dark.  The dials are marked form minimum to maximum for each of the three settings.  I don't know if its just me, but I find the dial markings cryptic, hard to see and somewhat worthless.  The only way I can get it set up is to turn each dial fully to one extreme and wave my hand in front of the sensor.  If the light comes on in a well lit room and stays on for a long time and I know I want it to only come on when it's pretty dark and maybe not stay on the maximum time, I can turn the time and ""Lux"" dial partway the opposite direction.  For my use, I like the sensitivity on MAX.Once, I had trouble with my 60 LED light when it quit working for no reason.  I contacted the manufacturer and they did a great job of troubleshooting the problem.  The fix was to switch it off for a couple of days and let it charge and reset.  After doing that, I've never had another problem since.  Both of my lamps are somewhat sheltered under the eaves of the house but the solar panels are fully exposed to the elements and I haven't had any problems with water effecting either the light or the solar panel.I'm completely sold on these lights.

B00FDQPCR2,A4D5B7Q8A7PA6,"If you're considering a solar-powered LED light for your garage or drive then you're probably in a situation where running a hard line is prohibitive or just something you don't want to mess with. So a solar light seems to be a perfect solution in that situation. I do want to point out that no current solar powered LED light can come close to a hardwired incandescent light. They're getting better and brighter and are lasting longer even on dull days, but you have to adjust your expectations and consider the juice required to get two 150 watt bulbs to light up. You just can't squeeze that kind of power out of a one foot square solar panel, not even close.However this light is the best and brightest I've installed, and works exactly as specified. Having a separate solar panel allows for mounting on the corner of your house or shed away from the light itself - up to fifteen feet using the small speaker wire supplied. This is good because you'll probably be mounting this under an eave or gutter where the sun doesn't shine and the wire is easy to staple down and tuck away.Once mounted, I decided to let it charge fully for two days with the unit in the off position. This isn't totally necessary but will effectively allow the light to have electricity &#34;buffered&#34; for those cloudy days so I recommend it. As with most motion sensitive lights you can set the sensitivity, duration and dusk/dawn options. This all worked as expected and I've had zero issues since installation. I haven't checked the specs but usually the rechargeable batteries aren't the highest grade and I may replace them towards next winter with 3200mah batts, should the need arise.So a really quick installation with virtually no fuss resulted in a perfect solar light that has a brightness that's surprising.

(I suppose the carrier liquid has to evaporate first, leaving the correct scent behind)Leather Scent:  When you smell it, you instantly recognize it as leather.  However it smells more like the tanned leather you would smell in a boot store, vs. the kind of leather smell you get form a leather seat.  But it's good, pleasant, and far less offensive smelling that the other scents from air fresheners.  Even when strong, it doesn't &#34;assault your nose&#34; like other scents.New Car Smell:  This is my favorite.  It is very hard to get a 'new car smell' scent, that doesn't smell like soap.  None that I sampled in local big box stores, or auto parts stores smelled anything close to correct.  This one is pretty darn good.  Every new car has a different complex smell, so it's hard to peg it exactly.  The best way I can describe it, is when you get into the vehicle, it smells new and clean.  Not soap-like, or bleach-like, just... clean.In my primary vehicle, I'll do one small 1/2 puff of the leather spray, just for a hint.  And maybe one full spray of the &#34;new car&#34; smell.  And it makes a good combo.I also have an ancient Buick, POS car, that has a tenancy to smell like a combo of mildew and old car.  For kicks I tried the new car smell in there, and found that it does have some real odor eliminating properties.  After about 4 shots of the spray, I came back the next day and smelled, and the &#34;old car smell&#34; was gone... as was most of the new car smell as well.  Another 3 sprays, spread around on carpet/seats, etc.  And the next day, there was a nice clean smell, and no old mildew smell.  Yeah.I didn't dilute the liquid (as the instruction say you can... but don't say with what or how much).  As it is now, even at full strength, each of these bottles will probably last well over a year for personal use.I've found them to be a great product.",5,"Both scents are accurate and good.

B00FJXKE5E,AJ3M8ZLT6W5CC,"I bought this unit in the presale off of Automatic's own website. I use it on iOS. I have used the unit since the first version of the app. The unit is great for looking at your driving habits and where you can improve. Also, it lets you keep track of where you have been. This alone is a very good feature. Despite what many may assume, you need to have the phone within range of the dongle, or it will not keep track of the car's location. This is not a suitable product if you want to check on your kid's driving habits, unless you install the app on their phones.Syncing the app with the dongle is very easy. If you follow the instructions, you can't screw it up.What I have noticed is that the ODB port and the Automatic make a relatively loose fitting. It should hold, but make sure you insert the dongle firmly and listen for the tone.I have never been in an accident since they added the Crash Alert feature, so I can't comment on it.One problem that I found (and the reason I took off two stars) is due to the erratic connectivity of the unit with the app. Before iOS7, the unit would sync every single trip I took. After the update, the unit seems to pick and choose when to sync the trip data. I often have gaps in my driving history that span a couple of days to even a couple weeks. I tried reinstalling the app and even reinstalling iOS on my phone. The developers need to make the product more robust in terms in connectivity.",3,Good for tracking locations.

I can also share details with family of where the car is parked if needed from my phone.My wife also has her phone paired to the device.

B00FJXKE5E,ARBKYIVNYWK3C,"I have had a long term interest in this type of product before they were even available. I love cars, technology and getting additional information from how I live, work and play. I have a Nest thermostat at home, I use Wemo devices to turn lights on/off from my phone and this is the next natural extension for me-- more information about my car and driving.I'll get the bad part out of the way first-- I had pairing issues at first. It may not have been more than 10 minutes of issues, but the app kept telling me to unplug & replug the device. Knowing how my phone works and the old &#34;have you rebooted yet?&#34; from the PC days, I rebooted my phone and everything continued on with no issues.Once sync'd and working, the device automatically detected my car and configured it for me. The app is absolutely beautiful, and intuitive. It easily shows you how your driving is going, when you park and aren't moving the app automatically shows you where the car is (no need to drill through a menu, just designed simply & in a smart way), and you can easily access settings, functions, etc. in a way that is easy to discover and understand. You don't need a manual to discover & use this product.I don't try to hyper-mile, but I did learn quickly that I'm already an efficient driver. My car does already show me current MPG and overall MPG, and I'm comparing this data to my car's data and it's very close. For someone who really does have no grasp on how efficient or aggressive they hit the gas & brake pedal, this can easily help those who don't know. It could also be great for teenagers who you want to remind when they're going over 70, but don't necessarily want to nanny-mom them with an expensive solution.I was most interested in the emergency function that could call if I had a bad crash. This is something that you have to pay $20 a month for, minimum, with something like OnStar. I'm surprised they haven't come out with a device like this yet. This is a curious feature because you'll never know how well it works until you have an emergency. Of course it won't work if you don't have cell signal, if your phone is damaged, or if the device is dislodged before the crash it detected, but I really liked the feeling of knowing there is at least potential for some automated process to take place if I should have a severe crash. a &#34;simulate emergency&#34; would be interesting to try so you can see what would happen without really calling 911 or your emergency contacts.I've discovered and enjoyed a lot with this device in only its first day. I did want to concur with the support comment on another reviewer's note that they couldn't connect with the car's Bluetooth hands-free with this device connected at the same time-- I had no issue doing that, and as well still maintaining a connection from my phone to my Jawbone UP24 all at the same time.I was also a little scared or put off by the review talking about personal data and VIN number and web-enablement. Every modern tool with a smart phone app stores its data in the cloud. Whether you call the cloud a cloud, a private cloud or a website, every other device I have does this, so in this case I did not feel concerned. My insurance company has my VIN and knows my driving history, the BMV has my VIN number, etc. I would like to know more specific information that is uploaded & stored about my driving history. Do they store constant GPS & location data/speed data, or only acceleration trends and start/stop location/park location? I plan to learn more on that point.I can really see the future potential for a product like this. One thing comes to mind is fuel and travel: If you're in a place with limited fuel stops/gas stations and it knows you are x miles from the next one and you only have 1/4 a tank, it could recommend that you fuel up soon, etc. It could recommend more fuel efficient routing of trips if I could sign in with Foursquare and it sees that I often go to the dry cleaner first, UPS store second and Walmart third. Maybe it makes more sense to go to the UPS store last because the total mileage of the trip would be shorter. The possibilities are endless and I'm excited!I had a simple device looking like this that could *only* read codes. This is a huge upgrade for not that much more in cost. I want to get one for everyone I know so we can compare stats!Feel free to ask any questions below in the comments and I will do my best to answer ASAP.",4,"A rough install, but a fantastic product!",1399852800,5,5,Automatic,Automatic Smart Driving Assistant,119.95

The product description states that these mats are designed for an exact fit and Avalanche is listed as one of the vehicles for this size.Unfortunately the full-size mats are a little too small for full coverage in the Avalanche. They are about and inch or two too narrow in height and width. This wouldn't be a problem in dry weather, but we live in the Midwest, and it rains and snows a lot. That exposed, unprotected strip of carpet will get dirty in no time.A second problem is there is no ridge on the edge of the mat to stop melting water from snow trapped on shoes and work boots from running into the carpeting. Also, the runner for the back is too short to fit lengthwise and would need to be cut into two small mats. Technically these mats will fit if you don't mind a little carpet exposed, but my husband opted to keep his old mats that provide 100% floor coverage.Happily, these mats fit my Mitsubishi Gallant, a mid-size vehicle, almost perfectly. They give full coverage and run right to the edge of the carpet, with only a little trimming needed at the top. I am thrilled. I needed new mats but didn't see an option for my car.

B00FRZPN64,A1BHSP8TPTH8Y5,"Quick Summary Review:I have both the Zubie and the Automatic, tested on a 2001 Olds Alero using an iPhone 5 with iOS7Pros for Zubie:The Battery Health Feature is good, and there are more car diagnostics.  This device isn&#8217;t Bluetooth dependent.It knows what the car is doing even when the cell phone isn&#8217;t there.  That&#8217;s nice for teenage drivers, or for checking on my car when parked in airport long-term parkingWith automatic, the app has to be on in the background, and the device will connect to the first user it sees.  If I go on a trip with my wife, Automatic might think that she is driving instead of meYou can share driver scores and car data with a group, which is useful for parents with teens.  My kids aren&#8217;t driving age for a couple of years, but when they turn 16 I&#8217;ll be looking for a product that supports this.Pros for Automatic:Both cost about the same up front, but the Zubie has a $99.99 annual service contract (because it uses the cell towers).  Because Automatic uses the cell phone for all transmissions, you only have to pay once.  Big PlusThe Automatic App is easier to navigateWith Zubie, the car is assigned to a driver.  All trips on the car will go to the assigned driver, regardless of who is actually driving the car.  You must actively change the active driver for the car, which is actually pretty easy to do, but easy to mess up.  There is no way to &#8220;fix&#8221; who the actual driver was after the fact.Crash Alert.  The device will alert pre-defined contacts and even an Automatic agent in case a crash is detected.Gas Prices.  It shows an estimated gas spent based on average fuel prices in the area.  Right now this functionality is limited, because it assumes a grade of gas and can&#8217;t be customized to what I actually paid for it.  It would be great if it knew I used 87 octane gas, when I fueled up, and what the price was at that station.It has audible feedback when you hard brake, hard accelerate, or exceed a speed.  These can be turned on or off, but can&#8217;t be tuned.  For example, Colorado has posted 75 speed limits, so exceeding a fixed 70MPH threshold isn&#8217;t valuable.Car location tracking:  This should be a pro for Zubie, I&#8217;m paying $99.99/year almost precisely for this reason.  However, time-after-time Zubie thinks my car is a block away (at a neighbors house) when it is clearly parked in my garage.  My cell phones are all properly detected in my house, but yet Zubie thinks my car is a block away.  That makes car location tracking useless!  Automatic knows where my car is, as long as I have my phone with me (which I always do)Both the same:Both products have limited functionality on a 2001 Alero.  My car just doesn&#8217;t send all of the signals that a new car does (i.e. Fuel Gage Level, MPG)Neither product has a good web interface, where you can set up your account, view metrics/data, etc&#8230;Conclusion:If I didn&#8217;t have smart phones for my family that I was already paying $150/month for, I&#8217;d be more positive for the Zubie.  That being said, I do have smart phones.  My smartphones and Automatic combined can do 95% of what Zubie and Zubie App can do (Car Location Tracking, Family Tracking, Driving Stats, Engine Health), and it can do several things that Zubie can&#8217;t (audible feedback, crash alert).  The 2 things that Zubie can do that Automatic can&#8217;t, only Battery Health is desirable. The other (tracking without a cell phone) is unnecessary for me.Since I have 2 cars, I&#8217;d end up paying $200/year (vs $200 once) to use Zubie.  That&#8217;s too much money for what is currently offered.  They need to find a way to either reduce the cost, or offer a 2-tiered product for those who don&#8217;t have a cell phone.  They state numerous times that they don&#8217;t make money off of the cell service, so they should find a way to eliminate it (or make it optional).Detailed Experience ReviewThe quick-start instructions were easy to follow.  First, I downloaded the app to the phone.  When I first opened the app, I was asked to create an account.  I was given the option to log-in from Facebook, which made the log in easy.  I was then prompted to create groups, which allow shared features.  I set up mine for my family.I then followed the instructions to activate the Zubie Key.  I liked that it used barcode scanning to detect the Zubie Key and Activation code.  It took about a minute to get my phone angled correctly to detect the 2-d barcode, but it worked.  It even detected by VIN barcode for my car, however I received an email about 10 minutes later saying by VIN barcode was invalid so I had to manually enter it.My family can be in my group without the app, but the value is more limited.  It does detect their location (like Find My Friends).  You can turn off location tracking within the app permanently (switch) or temporarily (up to 2 days).  Since I am using this with my family, I will leave the location tracking on (we have nothing to hide!).I took the car for a drive around the block, and when I came back home I looked at the stats.  For some reason, my car is shown parked a block away from my house (not anywhere near where I was driving).  This happens a lot.  I don&#8217;t have a lot of confidence in being able to find my car, when it says my car is 1-2 blocks away from reality.  Big minus.I&#8217;ve gone on several more drives, and I must say that the phone user interface needs some work.  Some of the features you need to &#8220;pull up&#8221; from the bottom,  which is nearly the same gesture on iOS7 to pull up the utility screen.  It is very frustrating to distinguish between the two gestures correctly.  Big minus.",3,Annual Fee makes this a no-go,1395187200,0,1,NA,"The Zubie Key, a Connected Car Service",79.96
B00FRZPN64,A17UNMURMLX0ZE,"The Zubie Vehicle Tracking and Engine Diagnostic Device plugs into your car's ODB-II port and uses a built in T-mobile cell service (not your phone) to upload data that you can monitor via the free app.The Zubie App works with or without the Zubie key and can be a cross platform &#34;find my friends&#34;.  With the app you can view location of any family member using the app as well as set up groups of friends.In addition to getting the location of others in your group that use the app you can also track the location of vehicles that have installed this key in your family. If a family member is in a car with the key the app automatically associates them together.For each vehicle that has a key you associate a primary driver and this driver earns a driving score based on their speed, hard accel/brake, night driving etc. The app can also send instant alerts when these occur as well as instant alerts when a vehicle arrives or leaves a location saved in your &#34;places&#34; list. These places have a perimeter associated with them. So you could set a small perimeter to get an alert anytime they arrive or leave the location or you could set a large perimeter and only get alerts if they leave the general area as the perimeter can be anywhere from 0.1 miles to 25 miles. Each place has its own notification rules and can be set for arrival, departure, or both.Trip maps show the start, end, and actual path of each drive. Top speed, idle time, and locations of acceleration and braking events are identified. For the map view you can view individual segments identified by anytime the vehicle is turned off, or a combined view over multiple trips or even multiple days.The engine diagnostic codes are very helpful. I have seen temporary codes here that didn't trigger a check engine on the dash and anytime the check engine light is on you should find details here on the fuel, emission, or other system. The Zubie also has an indication for the vehicle battery condition.The Zubie service does require a $99.95/year fee which is the same price as a new key. So you could consider the key is free, or you could ask why you don't get a discount the second year if you already have a key...I highly recommend this product for teen drivers. I am not suggesting you watch their every move, but a driver that knows their status is being recorded should be more careful. And if you have an issue with the driver not being where they are supposed to be, then you can log on together and review the records. The $100 you spend here is well worth the results.The ability to get diagnostic codes remotely is a nice feature, perhaps not enough to justify a $100/year service on its own though.These are missing features that I hope the app adds in the future, these are NOT in the app as of this review.Ability to see speed anywhere on trip not just top speed.Gas mileage as well as driver feedback reports on a regular basis to offer suggestions on how to improve their driving and get better fuel economy.",4,Track your vehicle and monitors engine diagnostics,1393459200,3,5,NA,"The Zubie Key, a Connected Car Service",79.96
B00FRZPN64,A2UOHALGF2X77Q,"The Zubie Key is a very interesting device. It's also pretty scary. First things first. I had an issue right out of the box getting the Zubie Key activated. The activation and installation process is simple, but it failed on my first attempt. For a couple of days it stated the connection to my vehicle was ""pending"". Then my vehicle connection completely disappeared. I emailed Zubie support, and within a couple of hours they replied with a new activation code. I had to start from scratch, but the second activation went fine. My vehicle was registered as soon as I took a short trip. I'm using the Android Application and it seems to work fine.Once activated and connected, this is where things get ""complicated"". As a gear and tech head, I like all information the Zubie Key provides. The vehicle diagnosis and monitoring are very useful. The ""driving monitoring"" has me concerned. The Zubie Key knows where you currently are, where you went, and how fast you got there. Zubie doesn't hide the fact that they store this information, and won't guarantee they won't share it. This is where I have total mixed feelings about the device. I love tech devices, and find the Zubie Key ""cool"" and useful. Allowing Zubie to track my every move and driving habits makes me want to remove the device ASAP. So I'm really conflicted.Things I like:Useful information.High on the coolness factor.Works well, and accurate.Things I do not like:Serious privacy concerns.Annual fee.My recommendation is this. If you're worried about the privacy issues, then I would avoid the Zubie Key. There's no getting around the fact that your data and driving information are being collected. There's no guarantee what Zubie will or won't do with this information. If you're the type of person that likes gadgets, and the privacy issues don't concern you at all, I can recommend the Zubie Key. It does everything as advertised. Overall I'm giving it 3 Stars.

B00FRZPN64,A3VTOLNB5N6FVP,"I like this idea mainly to keep track of my kids driving style, speed and location tracking. Privacy issues are clearly something to be aware of as you have no idea who might be able to access information you might want to keep private. This is simple to connect, under the dash of most cars made after 1996 and a few before this (my sons 1995 Volvo has a OBD2 outlet) you'll find an OBD2 outlet. Most state inspection stations use this outlet to check to insure you emissions are working correctly so watch where they plug in and this is the same place the Zubie Key goes. Some makers place this outlet in other locations like under the ash tray or inside the center console storage area. Anyway it syncs data from your car directly to an app on your smartphone and stores info such as hard acceleration, hard breaking, speeding, nighttime driving and idling. You're given a score on your driving skills on a scale of 100. Your score can be compared to other drivers in your family or the entire Zubie community.

Zubie doesn't send out e-mails if they make the Privacy Policy even more intrusive than it already is.  Here are some of the ""highlights"":* Zubie can collect the the location of your car AND cell phone, including when the primary driver is within 500 feet of your car;* Zubie collects your Facebook profile, including friends and their contact information (for the purpose of sending them Zubie ads);* at the end of your contract, your credit card is automatically charged again, presumably with no reminder or notice;* all this information will be given when Zubie is presented with ""lawful"" requests from government agencies (no mention of subpoenas or court orders required from said government agencies -- which begs the question, does the NSA have stock in the company?);* Zubie can sell your information to third party vendors or partners, including advertisers;* this one is copied and pasted directly from Section 10 of Zubie's Terms of Use (I couldn't make this up if I tried, and the all-caps are by Zubie, not me) -- ""THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL MATERIALS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, ARE PROVIDED ON AN &#8220;AS IS&#8221; AND &#8220;AS AVAILABLE&#8221; BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THE WARRANTY OF NON&#8209;INFRINGEMENT.

Other reviewers have talked about the privacy concerns, and it seems that this device really would only be worth considering if you are a parent wishing to track the driving habits of your teenage driver.

B00FRZPN64,A2PMR2PIGWKCQ9,"First off, my kids are not old enough to drive and I don't drive like a manic, so I really just don't see any value in it.  In a week or two of using it, it has told me absolutelly nothing, other than I spend a lot of time idling (waiting in line to pick up kids after school), which I already knew.  This morning I had a really hard time starting my car in cold weather(32 degs - cold for houston, lol), but zubie didn't give me any kind of battery alerts and I know my battery is old and needs to be replaced. It makes me wonder just how far does your battery have to go before it will alert you to a problem. My check engine light isn't on, so I haven't received any info on that end either other than that everything is okay.  As far as engine and battery status goes, I think a bluetooth odbII reader would be better suited and would provide more information.Activation was easy enough, as long as you take note of what other reviewers have said about removing the space that appears at the end of the activation key when you scan it - I had already read about this problem before I started so right after I scanned it, I removed the trailing space at the end of the key before I proceeded and everything went without a hitch.  Still kinda dumb that the problem still persists even after being reported and I'm sure it will cause a lot of people problems when trying to activate.And then there are the privacy concerns - I know a lot of people are worried about what they will actually do with the information they gather, and I think it's a valid concern but I'm not sure really just how big of a deal it is.  Even so, when I signed up I gave them minimal information just in case. I'm not going to dwell on the privacy issue for this review because other reviewers have already gone into great detail and done thorough research on it.But even if you can get past the privacy concerns, I'm just not sure an adult would get any real world use for their $99/year.  It could be useful to find your car if it was stolen, since it does have the capability to show it's location on a map, but I'm sure thieves will quickly learn to unplug it before taking off in your car.As far as reporting driving habits - I think most people are well aware of how they drive and don't really need a $100/yr device to tell them if they brake hard or accelerate too fast.  The only way I could possibly see using it, is to put it in a teens car so that you can monitor their driving, and even then I would only do it for maybe the first year, if at all.As for the app, it's somewhat limited in features and very buggy.  It crashes multiple times, freezes and overall just acts weird.  The only cool feature it has is to pinpoint my car on a map, but even then all it does is tell me my car is outside in my driveway, lol.  Maybe I'm too boring for it.At this point, the whole product feels like a beta implementation with limited features.

My car is a 2003, and I like that the Zubie monitors and tells me if I'm having engine or battery problems; these provide the most value for me. The engine analyzer checks the oxygen sensor, evaporative system, catalyst, components, fuel system, oxygen sensor heater and misfire. While I'm not sure what all of these mean, I know they can get expensive to repair and/or cause mileage efficiency issues. Fortunately (keeping my fingers crossed), I haven't received any error codes since I've been using it, but that is a nice feature to have available for the technician (they're no longer called mechanics). It also gives you a battery check, as well.The trips function is nice to have, but I don't get a lot out of this.

The app itself was confusing to use as some of the information would be under a subheading in the menu that was not immediately apparent, ie old trips seem to have disappeared after a day or two but could be found by going through 3 menus, after two days of not driving that particular car (the key is still installed) the app has forgotten that I have a car set up, although I did find an engine and battery alert notification that when selected show no information.Just to test the tracking abilities I went to a private lot in the snow and spun the car around, when i checked the app later that day it did not show any alerts related to that so presumably your teenage drivers could still be getting away with hooligan behavior and you would never be notified.The battery in my car is not all that old and has never had any issues so i was quite surprised that after about a week of being plugged into my car (the last 3 days I did not drive it) Zubie notified me that the battery was getting low. I had previously seen that other reviews mention similar things, hopefully this will be addressed in an update soon.Finally I found that on my particular car (1999 Mazda Miata) the diagnostic port that the Zubie app so helpfully located for me was just underneath and to the left of the steering wheel, but due to the size of the key i had to remove and store the diagnostics port cover which is also the fuse block cover.",3,Easy to Use but SERIOUS Privacy Issues,1393113600,4,6,NA,"The Zubie Key, a Connected Car Service",79.96

Unfortunately, you can only receive the data from the Key on your smart phone, since there is no web page or internet portal, but that is the only real complaint that we had about this service.Set-up was quick and easy on both our 2012 Toyota Prius V and our 2011 Subaru Legacy.  The system also lets you move it between the two cars without needing to buy a second service account.Some of the reviewers are complaining about the $100 a year price being high.  Considering the Zubie Key has its own cellular data connection, this price is very reasonable.  It wouldn't surprise me if they are losing money on their first few thousand customers because of the cellular data costs, until they hit a breakeven point on their other expenses.  Compared to other options that don't have their own cellular connection and GPS, this might be the best value ever in parental aids for teenage drivers.  Considering the damage to property, lives, and their future that teenage driving can cause, this is the best protection you can buy for when your teenagers are driving.In my opinion, it doesn't matter how much you trust your kids, driving a car is too huge a responsibility for young drivers to do it unsupervised.  Not having a tool like this Zubie Key Service installed creates enables temptations to drive recklessly or not follow your rules that are too big for even the most responsible young-adults to handle.Compared to services like this from Ford and other car manufacturers, this is cheaper, more effective, and easier to use.  I found it simple to use and feel that it covers all the bases needed for young drivers.  No, it doesn't have a Breathalyzer or a direct way to tell you if the cell phone is being used, but by monitoring things like hard braking and fast acceleration, it indirectly gives you this information.Because of the lack of privacy protections, I will never drive with this installed again (beyond a few days of testing it).  I pull it out of the plug as soon as I get in the car.  Conversely though, our teenage drivers will never operate one of our cars without this installed, now that we have it.  Our new rule is that driving our car requires the Zubie Key to be installed.I strongly recommend that all parents of young drivers get this.  I wish that my parents had it back when I was a young driver, because only luck (or divine intervention) prevented me from ruining my life the lives of others.  As for using it to monitor yourself, I strongly discourage it.  Being tracked by your cell phone is bad enough.  Do you really want to give them another way to take your actions out of context and put your Liberty at risk?One last comment.  You might be thinking that I don't trust kids, or have something against teenagers.  I don't.  I believe that kids of all ages should be given a very long leash (figuratively) relative to their age.  Despite this trust, and desire to give freedom, the reality is that driving a car is the most dangerous and life altering thing that a young adult does.  To not use a tool like this to assist them in their newfound responsibility is missing out on a great opportunity to coach, teach, and protect.",4,"A Godsend for parents of teenage drivers, but not something I will ever use to monitor myself",1390521600,5,9,NA,"The Zubie Key, a Connected Car Service",79.96

B00G25GOCA,A2DYMDOAJURO5F,"I was given a sample Roll of 3Ms Wrap and Repair Silicone Tape (1in x 2 yd) to test and evaluate. I repaired a leaking water hose, a leaking kitchen gasket before calling the plumber. I taped the handle of my shovel that was giving me wood splinters, and taped my finger for a day for good measure. I was very happy with all results. No residue or wear was left on my finger.Silicon is a remarkable substance. Wikipedia notes that silicon provides minimal heat conduction, toxicity and chemical reactivity. It repels water and can form watertight seals. It is resistant to oxygen, ozone, ultraviolet light and microbial growth. It is stable over a wide range of temperatures. It can be used as electrical insulation and has some fire protection properties. It is highly gas permeable. It sticks to glass. This product sticks to itself when tightly stretched.What this means to me is that I can:* Carefully, and not too tightly, temporarily wrap it directly around a wound on my body or repair a medical cast being careful not to cut off circulation.* Repair glazing seals since silicon sticks well to glass* Repair gaskets, hoses and leaking pipes around my car, lawn irrigation, pool and general plumbing whether outdoors or indoors. Whether I decide it to be a semi-permanent or temporary fix will depend on how lucky I feel.* Use it when I am missing electrical tape* Repair a broken wooden handle on my hammer, shovel, frying pan or anywhere else a more comfortable grip is needed.The packaging label reads:""Repair hose, tool, pipe or electrical surfaces with this super stretchy, highly conformable, adhesive-free tape that fuses strongly to itself and can withstand extreme temperatures -85F to 500F. Designed to be heat, friction, and UV resistant, this versatile tape meets UL 510 standards and can be used for automotive, marine, home and recreational repairs.Directions:1. Prepare and clean the surface to be wrapped.2. Peel back the liner and wrap the necessary amount of tape around the repair surface stretching the tape and overlapping by half the width.3.

It sticks to itself and somehow forms a tight bond with the surface you wrap with it. Over time, the tape's bond to itself becomes permanent. The repairs it makes are good for some time. I keep a roll of this in my RV. It is heatproof so it can repair a hot water pipe, a garden hose, or anything else you can wrap.

Also, relying exclusively on duct tape to handle whatever catastrophe is on your handyperson horizon, may doom your future repair.This product, when applied properly, eliminates the &#34;struggle factor&#34; involved when attempting to wrap and seal a leak. That's a significant advantage when you're in &#34;emergency&#34; mode. Upon application, it requires that you (moderately) stretch this ribbon of silicone, which makes both sides attach themselves to each other and also allows adequate pressure at the leak to seal it. Since silicone reacts with virtually nothing, it tends to hold its shape and make the fix semi-permanent.For increased longevity, or when attempting to block a stream of hot automotive coolant, duct tape adhesive may very likely let you down. The pressure that this tape applies is superior to duct tape, which isn't elastic, and therefore doesn't maintain compression on the puncture/crack/gap, allowing fluid to gradually saturate the adhesive and work its way out.Be aware that one thing this product can't do is seal a leaky pipe as it butts up against a flange. A surface angled at 90 degrees will not provide an adequate area to allow a proper &#34;wrap&#34;.Get some, before your next MacGyver street cred. challenge.",5,Avoid Struggling with Leaks (and Dissolving Duct Tape Adhesive),1394668800,0,0,3M,3M (03625) 1&quot; x 6' Wrap and Repair Silicone Tape,6.48

I also learned a few things when I used this product.I started out by shaking the bottle well (as per the instructions) and then spraying all over the driver side of the dashboard, steering wheel and the control panel - basically I sprayed on surfaces as far as my hand could reach from the driver side. The point is that I thought I'd spray as much as I could at first, and then wipe away. Bad idea! And don't do it if it's your first time. Because it turned out that the somewhat milky liquid dries up fairly quickly. And it starts to leave behind a residue if you don't wipe it quickly enough. I ended up spraying over the same surfaces again, this time only a little and then wiping quickly. Then it worked well. Once I learned that lesson, everything was fine.The shine that this detailer left behind was very noticeable on my tan interior of the Civic. Not so much on the dark grey interior of the Accord. But still, in both cars, it ended up cleaning all surfaces very well. And as others mentioned, the smell is very nice!One more tip. Try not to spray on the windows - or if you do, make sure you wipe it off quickly, while you can still see it. Because if you don't, that same residue that I spoke of earlier may affect your sight later on. For me I didn't notice I had some of this liquid on the passenger side window, and only while driving I noticed that there was some of this liquid blocking my clear vision of the side mirror.

I've been using them on my truck since I got it in 2008 and I think the paint looks as good as it does today because of that despite the harsh Texas summers which last about 6 months around here.To use the refresher you need to leave your vehicle running, with the AC on, for 15 minutes. That's not a big deal but you do need to be where your car is secure and/or under close observation.The new car scent is not bad but not fantastic either (to me). It is strong the first day or two after application then it is just a very pleasant clean smell. I used mine about 40 days ago and it still smells fresh when I open the door after it has been sitting. I smoke in my truck so that is impressive.

After 6 months and 8,000 miles the A/C was getting a bit musty so I was hoping this product would kill any bacteria and/or mold in the condenser heat exchanger.I discovered that the tiny little can contained more than enough for the interior volume of the Avalon and it completely eliminated any semblance of odor from the A/C unit. However, even though it was supposed to be &#8220;new car&#8221; fragrance, I found it to be a flowery scent and not at all like a &#8220;new car.&#8221; Had I used it in my truck I would have not liked it at all, but my wife had no issues with it.To use this whole-cabin deodorizer, the engine must be run with the A/C on max for 15 minutes without anyone in the car. Not only is that in the instructions, I&#8217;m not sure there is other way to effectively deodorize the whole cabin including the A/C. That said, I have had some success in deodorizing an A/C by opening up the cabin filter box, removing the filter, and spraying vast quantities of room odor eliminator (Lysol makes one) directly into the system while the fan is running at max.Airing out the vehicle for 10 minutes, per instructions, was not enough for me. This stuff was pretty strong and took about a week for the odor to come down to where it didn&#8217;t irritate me when I got in the car. Remember though, that my wife liked the fragrance so she had no issues with the strength.Since I didn't have a car with pet odors, vomit, or baby messes to test this on, I can only state that this is probably strong enough to kill those odors if the mess is cleaned first.

B00G49NYKY,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,"I've used various tire shine products, but I think Dub is about the best.  It is easier to apply than most liquid sprays.  You might think an aerosol can would cause more overspray than liquid, but this goes on very nicely and it clings to the tires as you spray it, so unlike a liquid product (like Armour All) it doesn't end up on the car paint and wheels much at all.Also, the spray nozzle can be turned from left to right (L, M, and H settings) to control the scope of what you spray.As far as the citrus smell, it smells more like nail polish remove and oranges mixed together, but the odor is not really noticeable beyond a few inches from the tire and only briefly upon application.NOTE: like any product of this type, this can make surfaces slick, so do not put it on tire treads, thin tires like on bikes, or places you may step, like running boards.What I really like about the product....beyond just making tires shiny and wet looking, I tried this on the black and gray plastic trim on my cars.  I have a 2001 Volvo S60 and I sprayed this on the gray trim on the side and bumpers and it made it look brand new again.  Thanks to the adjustable nozzle I was also able to apply ti without much, if any, overspray onto the car finish itself.It hasn't worn off yet, through a couple of heavy rainstorms and several days of wear.

B00G49NYKY,A2WB7LZ595CR50,"I normally use Meguiar's Hot Shine spray.  It has served me quite well for the past few years but I figured I'd give this DUB spray a try.  I was hoping it would be even better than their Hot Shine.  The DUB spray does give tires a deep wet look.  Depending on how much you use, it could easily end up looking too wet.  I had that unfortunate experience and my tires looked exactly like they used to when I'd apply Black Magic silicone tire dressing back in the early 90's; messy and greasy.  It comes in an aerosol can with an adjustable spray nozzle but regardless of the setting, the spray comes out in a direct stream.  It took a little time to get accustomed to the narrower stream.  I didn't fare too well during the first application.  It felt like I used at least a third of the can to coat all four tires.  Afterward, my tires had the sloppy overly-glossy look described earlier and during the first drive, the excess was thrown onto my vehicle body despite the vehicle sitting stationary for over 18 hrs in warm temperatures after the application.  After a week of driving, I decided I wasn't really impressed and subsequently wrote a three-star review.  I did note how well the dressing withstood a heavy downpour and how the shine lasted very good for the entire week.  However, the original overly glossy appearance, excess kickback on my paint, and the nozzle's spray pattern seriously tainted my opinion.  I figured, I tried it, didn't like it and would resume using Hot Shine.Well, little did I know, I had yet to see the true capability of the DUB dressing.  The shine actually lasted TWO WEEKS.  I'm not talking about a barely visible shine.  My tires still looked as if a tire dressing was just recently applied a day or two ago.  They never dulled, even after a couple weeks of daily commuting and several heavy downpours.  My neighbor had his car washed and his tires dressed on the very same day I washed my car and applied the DUB.  His tires were dull a few days later after a couple of heavy rain storms.  After two weeks, my tires looked better than his tires looked the day he washed his car.  Now THAT caught my attention.  I had to admit I was thoroughly impressed.  I just washed my car again today and after applying the DUB a little more carefully, my tires look fantastic.  I also noticed the DUB doesn't drip and stain the driveway like my Hot Shine does.  Every time I'd pull away after applying Hot Shine, there would be four teltale greasy spots underneath where I'd sprayed the tires.  Well, DUB doesn't leave that greasy residue on the driveway.  After reconsidering how well the DUB performed, there was no justifiable way I could leave the original three star review intact.The DUB spray also smells very pleasant, but with all the unhealthy chemicals in these sprays, I don't think you should spend too much time inhaling the nice citrusy aroma.I can admit when I'm wrong and I was definitely wrong about DUB.  My first review stated I would continue using Hot Shine.  Well, I don't think I will be buying another bottle of Hot Shine anytime in the foreseeable future.

B00G49NYKY,A1MCH5RXDOH87H,"The product calls for one or two coats for best effects. One coat, what I use and prefer, gives a nice gloss finish to the tire. It's slightly subdued and doesn't make the tire look like it's been coated with a half inch of wax like car tires do at the dealerships. Two coats, which I tried a day or two before having the car washed, was closer to those heavy gloss ultra wet looking tires that I don't really care for. The car wash actually knocked the shine down to about where I like it.The spray is fairly durable. We had a couple days of rain and after a hundred or two miles in puddles and running on the highway there was still some gloss left on the tires.Application is what I felt to be the weakest point of this product. The cap is supposed to be adjustable from narrow to wide spray. Mine may have been defective but no matter what way I turned the cap the spray was the same; nearly jet like, narrow and far too forceful. Attempting a light coat on the tire I still had considerable run off and puddles left on the garage floor which required cleaning and still left those sections of the floor slippery. This product just feels... wasteful. I much prefer a tire shine that applies as a liquid or paste and uses a sponge. You get better control, coverage and less waste.As for the Orange Crush scent? There was a hint of orangeness in the air and while it wasn't unpleasant it wasn't something exceptional either.All in all it's not a horrible product and I'll use up this can I was sent but I doubt I'll buy more when it's gone.",3,"DUB Tire Shine..

B00G49NYKY,A2W9I628I6SE1U,"I've had a difficult time finding a tire gloss protectant that lasts. With DUB U1319, I think I've gotten as close as I can with a spray. I don't mind foams too much, but they do drip, and the resultant shine doesn't last for very long. DUB's clear spray goes on easily and drips less, though it comes out a little strong. The adjustable nozzle is a nice touch, but the difference between the thin and wide sprays isn't very large. Still, good enough for my needs. I use it at nearly full wide for a single sweep around each tire.One coating gives the tire a glossy black shine that last for 1-2 weeks, even in rainy South Florida conditions. Again, this is the longest lasting spray I've yet to use and it even does a good job on reviving worn, older tires. Two consecutive coats will give your tires that super glossy showroom/just-detailed look. A nice option if you want that. The mild orange scent is mainly for the ""enjoyment"" of the person applying the tire shine. It fades quickly after the first drive. It might be a nice touch if you are showing off your car somewhere though.Another quality vehicle product from Meguiar's. Good pricing, and it nicely compliments the DUB U1422 Wheel Cleaner.

I bought a bucket that collects dirt at the bottom from chemical guys. I mix two capful of this and half bucket of water. Make sure to buy good and absorbant micro fiber cloth. If you do it right it shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to wash your car and it will shine as if you waxed it.

This towel is made of microfiber materials and is very soft and I carefully noted that on my Corvette it did not leave any cloth marks, however that car does have a great wax finish and scraping that wax would not be easy. The towel does absorb good and the size is very good. I have yet to figure out the use of those pickets on both ends. The manufacturer writes that you can put your hands in those pockets and you get a better grip on the towel. Maybe--maybe not!

This is a  good product.",5,Good Drying Towell,1393372800,2,2,Zwipes,Zwipes 671 Blue/Black 40&quot; x 25&quot; Ultimate Dry Combo Pocketed Drying Towel and Dry Blade,23.28
B00H72YG9U,A14JBDSWKPKTZA,"I had a high end body shop for 20 years. Did a lot of fine polishing when refinishing high end imports. Protecting those finishes while washing and drying was an art form. A major consideration was making sure no gravely, gritty stuff was picked up and carried across the finish. Bird droppings were always a concern because they would stick like glue to the surface of the car and birds consume gravel in order to properly grind/mash their food. So first step is using the hose properly to loosen, and remove anything that even loosely resembles grit. After wetting the entire care you start off soap washing from the roof of the car. Go all the way around the roof down to the belt line at the base of the windows.Why do it this way? Because what you are trying to prevent is using a soapy pad around the rocker moldings, and bottoms of the doors picking up anything that can scratch, and then using that soapy pad to carry those scratchers across the rest of the car. So by starting at the top and working your way down you eliminate that possibility. If the car is immaculate and all that is on it is silt then of course this isn't so much of a concern.But if it has road sludge even after rinsing the real ugly stuff off it is best to start from the top and work down. If you were being extra careful, after you got done the roof, on the secondary pass you could wash only down to the lower part of the doors, but not include the rockers and underneath the rockers until you make a final pass. The final pass would then be only on the rockers, and the bottom part of the bumpers etc.So what does this have to do with the towel? Well proper drying can be a challenge when you are looking at fine finishes. So you want a soft, absorbent towel that will pick up the water, but not leave water residue behind. Some towels do a gross job of collecting water. They tend to leave a coating of water behind which is enough to leave water marks on the finish. We used to use a chamois so as to protect the finish, and get a fine level of water off. After a while a synthetic drying chamois came out that worked even better than the real thing; at least it got the job done quicker. Here is an example of one here: http://www.amazon.com/Absorber-Synthetic-Drying-Chamois-Natural/dp/B0000AY69V/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1397591409&sr;=8-1&keywords;=chamoisNone of the chamois either real or synthetic do the job of drying a car more efficiently than a soft absorbent large sized towel. If you are a shop you would need a built in washer and dryer. Also I don't think in terms of personal home use of joining my car washing towel in with my laundry. So a separate wash cycle for your car towel may be in order. The chamois never get that. They dry hard after only a rinsing, but you purposely wet them anyhow before use which softens them right up. You just wring out the excess water, and wipe away.The pockets on the end of these towels are nice if you want to get around the headlights, or around the wiper area or bumper etc. It would pay you to use the pockets on opposite ends, one each so you are not touching/dragging the towel along the ground. By using one pocket at each end it gives you a lot more control, and having pockets in the first place gives you more control over just grabbing one end of a regular towel. Actually having two of these towels would be ideal; one for getting the rough water off, and a second for finishing the job. I see that one of the versions of this product comes with a squeegee, but I am not a fan of a hard plastic base with a softer nylon squeegee attached to it. There are too many ins and outs and areas that would enable the hard plastic base to bump into the finish on the car. To me two towels is the way to go.Anyhow I hope this helps.

I often get frustrated because my F150 dries before I can get it sufficiently wiped down, leaving spots on my truck. The 'Dry Blade' comes in handy, especially on those large areas (hood, sides). That way you aren't trying to remove every drop of water by absorbing it with a towel. The blade is slick and, if you did a good job cleaning, should not cause any scratches. It also works well for window glass, which are often smeared by towels.The Pocketed Drying Towel is simply a large microfiber towel. For whatever reason, microfiber feels weird to me... like it wants to stick to me. But it still does a good job. Overall, microfiber is pretty absorbent and this towel is no exception.

I wish is were twice the size for the price. Bamboo is actually a type of grass not wood.  Bamboo cutting boards are hard, plus the fact that they are very resistant to bacteria. Regular wood cutting boards, over time, get grooves in them where bacteria can get caught and transfer to food. This is especially true if the cutting board is not cleaned properly.You need to &#8220;season&#8221; bamboo cutting boards regularly &#8212; which can be time consuming. Seasoning will prolong the life of your bamboo cutting board. To season your board, first wash it with hot soapy water. Then, wait for the board to dry. Once it&#8217;s dry, saturate the board with food-safe mineral oil. Wipe the mineral oil off. Repeat this process at least 2 more times before using it for the first time. After that, you&#8217;ll want to re-season the board every month. You have to wash a bamboo cutting board by hand. It cannot be put in the dishwasher because there are more glued pieces that could come apart than with regular wood cutting boards. Bamboo cutting boards are more expensive than regular wood cutting boards. In fact, they&#8217;re among the most expensive cutting boards on the market today. Way too high maintenance for me.Some bamboo cutting boards are glued together with adhesives that have formaldehyde in them &#8212; which could eventually leak into and contaminate food. When buying a bamboo cutting board, make sure that it has a non-toxic label on it in order to avoid this.

B00HWIZO6I,A3AYSYSLHU26U9,"Nova Leather Conditioner & Restorer has so many uses, but my primary use is for the interior vinyl and leather seats of my Mercedes Benz and BMW Z3 Convertible. What most people do not realize is that over conditioning leathers can actually do more damage than good. When leathers are done, they have special detergents and agents added. Over conditioning can remove this agents and decrease the life of your leather. This is highly important with the interiors of vehicles since certain areas of the seats are constantly use. Vinyl can be conditioned more often, but I condition my leather seats only two to three times a year.The Nova Leather Conditioner & Restorer comes with an application round sponge. It is always best to work with warm leather because this opens the pores and allows the conditioner to work itself deep inside and be better absorbed in the leather. The seats in both cars are heated, so I just let them warm up for one cycle. You can always just use a hair dryer to warm the leather up.Apply a small amount of the conditioner avoiding any stitching, and work in small circular motions. No need to rub hard, just press gently. After finishing the application, use a microfiber cloth and remove/buff the conditioner using small circular motions as you would when waxing a vehicle. Your cloth will probably end up picking up dirt and grime.This is a very important to do in my convertible because of the hot sun that hits the interior when the top is down. In between conditioning all you need to do is use a soft damp microfiber cloth to wipe the seats, this will keep the seats looking clean and soft.Nova leather conditioner is a great product to use all your leather and vinyl needs, the scent takes a bit to use to but it will disappear after the application is complete. Leaves your leather looking new, soft and non greasy.

I've been using Lexol for years on many items.Leather Nova isn't made from animal products and doesn't list the ingredients.  But through email with a Leather Nova representative, I learned that it's made from entirely from a synthetic polymer that's a trade secret.In the couch face off, I discovered that I had to use a lot more Lexol than Leather Nova to cover the entire area.  I used Leather Nova on the red couch and Lexol on the green couch (see photos).Leather Nova left the red couch looking wet and shiny after completely buffing it and it was dry to the touch.Lexol left the green couch feeling almost the same and it was flat, not shiny after complete buffing and dry to the touch.Naturally, I got some drops of both conditioners on the mat (see photo).  Lexol was simple to wipe up.  Not Leather Nova.  I wiped and wiped the mat but it looked shiny.  I ended up wiping some Leather Nova over the entire mat - surely just some drops.  Now, 2 days later the mat looks shiny and feels a little slippery when stepped on with socks.Separately, I used Leather Nova on a leather jacket that I've had for about 10 years.  The leather feels much softer and just today somebody commented on my new leather jacket.  I believe it was mistaken as new because of the smell, which one can identify as a leather smell yet maybe not only leather.My conclusion is these are both excellent leather conditioners and that the user should first determine if the finished product should look wet or flat.

It&#8217;s a pretty thin consistency, which makes it, for me, easier to work with than conditioners that are the consistency of hand cream. The thinness makes it easy to get the conditioner into seams and crevices.

I have used some Scotchgard Shoe Guard in the past, but apart and aside from protecting them, it doesn&#8217;t condition my shoes. They really need a pick-me-up now and then and the Leather Nova did just that. I cleaned them with a damp cloth and let them set a while before conditioning them with the Leather Nova.When I was finished I was some impressed with the results. The Nova appears to be an oil-based conditioner and readily absorbed into the shoes. I only had to put a small amount on the included sponge applicator to spruce them up.

It had no harsh chemical smell, but as with any product, application in an open area is a must. In addition to the improved appearance of my Merrells I especially liked the ease of application.

It even soaked into the stacked synthetic-leather heel and covered the scuffs on the backs caused by driving.Although it's not sold as a water-proofing product, this conditioner renewed and moisturized my leather barstool seats and water beads up on them now.  I used it next on the brown leather belt my husband uses on his work pants.  That poor belt was so dry and worn that it was cracking, but the conditioner soaked right in and it looks much better (it doesn't fix cracks, but prevents further damage).  A word of caution:  if you have light colored leather, this product will darken it slightly.Finally, I used Leather Nova on my leather car seats.

B00HWIZO6I,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,"Leather Nova leather conditioner is applied to smooth, soft leathers to restore the texture and appearance and also renew that unique leather smell.

B00I93BOZ0,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,"I own several LED light strip sets which I've placed in my home office for ambient lighting in the room, and around my desktop computer. This set for the interior of a vehicle caught my eye as it's essentially the same as the other Sylvania Mosaic kit I own, but on a much smaller scale with a 12V (cigarette lighter powered) adapter.When I first opened up the box I was delighted with the quality and inclusions in this set. For a very reasonable price you get (2) 12"" light strips with the ability to add more LED lights with a kit (not included). The wiring which is long enough to work in my 2003 Toyota 4-Runner, can be left to power on and off as you turn on your vehicle or you can use the included IR (infa-red) remote to do it.The remote is small (a little bigger than a credit card) and light, and easy to lose. I put a small circle of Velcro on the back and the other piece of Velcro on a spot near my console to I'd have it at arms reach. The IR receiver is about the size of a pencil eraser, and you have to aim your remote at it to operate the remote which can be tricky at times, but it works well when placed correctly and has about a 6' range.The connections on all LED light strips are frustratingly fragile! If you break off a pin, you'll be limited in the color options and features you can use with the remote. Just take it slow and be gentle when connecting the wires to your light strips!Two 12"" strips offer more than ample illumination in 16 different colors in the cabin of my vehicle. I actually run with them on a dim brightness setting because most of the time anything higher can be blinding!These are a very cool addition to any vehicle, including RVs and boats with a 12V plug. They are not waterproof or water resistant and you may need to cover them with clear packing tape to get them to adhere to surfaces in your vehicle. The 3M backing is sticky, but it seems that if these are installed when it's either too hot or too cold - their adhesion is 'iffy' even on a very clean, dry surface. This goes with ALL LED light strips of any brand I've ever used though.I really like this set, and if it was given to a high schooler for graduation, they'd love it!  I'm forty-ish and it makes my teenage daughter cringe to be seen with me at night when I turn them on, so they work for me too.

B00I93BOZ0,A27QXQQOLAMRRR,"All too often you find that a device that says it is made for 12V car systems is not really made well for such systems... Most of the time they are only made to work at 12V and nothing higher. This is a no go when it comes to cars seeing as cars don't actually run at 12V.When a car is running (engine on) and idle is above 1000rpm the charging system of the car will easily put out 13.8V to the rest of the car. meaning that your 12V device is actually getting 13.8 volt instead of 12V. Even batteries don't put out just 12V. A car battery when it is good will put out voltage up to 12.7V (typical is 12.65V). While these numbers may seem rather small in difference to you it makes a world of a difference when it comes to LEDs, cell phone chargers and so on.The vast majority of cheap products are made so cheaply and only designed to work at 12V only. So your device ends up running hot and the LEDs get burnt out in a year or less because they get too much power.This is the first reasonably priced product I've seen in some time that doesn't have those issues. I hooked these to my lab testing equipment to test for several hours before I considered installing these in my car. I left the supply at 13.9V for several hours and the lights only got warm to the touch and the supply box was only mildly warm as well. and by warm I mean even with using my laser temperature sensor and even a temperature probe I didn't get temperatures over 90 degrees F. Which is well within the tolerances of electronic devices. This was also done in a garage that was sitting at 84 degrees for the majority of that time. So while some heat was produced I was also over driving them by 0.1V which can easily happen in an automotive situation.These lights have performed well beyond my expectations. I would however say that if you want to make the system look nice and clean but don't want to cut the wires of the existing system just get a stand alone 12V socket and just attach it to the back of your existing 12V power socket in your car and then you can hide the wires wherever you want. Just remember that you never want to coil wires that have power running through them. It creates an electromagnetic field that can heat up metals near it and start a fire. So it may be in your best interest to cut the excess wires...Also the lights themselves put out good light and the color options are pretty good. Though it would be nice to be able to fine tune the colors if you like a specific color but that's not that big of a deal. IMO. It also has a memory of the last used settings so if you like a particular setting it will keep it that way.I would recommend running these lights dimmed while riding at night as it will help with eye fatigue. If you are not familiar with that you should definitely look up that subject. In relation to lights while driving at night.Bottom line. Get this if you have a desire to get different colors at your feet in your car and know that the system seems to be rather well built.",5,Nice light and the color selection is pretty decent.

B00I93BOZ0,A1BHSP8TPTH8Y5,"Ok- let me preface this review with I am NOT a car decorating person. I ordered these to make my friends and family laugh when they got into Old Red (you know, the Escape that has torn leather seats, 175k+ miles on it, and you're dang lucky she starts in the dead of the Northern winters). Anyway, we hooked them up according to instructions and voila! They light, they flash, they strobe, they change color and laughter from the people in the car ensures. We placed them under the front seats so the glow radiates from below and plugged them in using the cigarette lighter adapter. The adhesive seems to work well on the leather bottomed seats and the cords all plugged into one another. Make sure you have the plugs in the right way so there's a current flowing. i suspect this maybe what happened to other people who couldn't get them to work- you have to make sure the cords are in the correct slots, not just all thrown together.

Each strip is a foot long and has an adhesive backing on it. It also includes 2 three foot connection cables and a two-way splitter, car adapter, remote control and mounting tape and rubbing alcohol. All of the cables are long enough for what I need them for and the cables are good quality, not cheap junk.Most everything about this set is very simple to install with one exception. I tried to install these LED light strips in my Dodge Ram 1500 and I found it impossible to mount them on anything. The LED strips have an adhesive strip on the back of them. It's 3M adhesive tape which should be really good but didn't work out for me. You are supposed to clean the area with rubbing alcohol where you intend to mount them. Then remove the tape and press them into place. When you touch the adhesive it seems like it should work because it sticks to your finger really well. However it won't stick to my dash or any of the plastic trim in my truck. I tried over and over again and it won't stick at all. It won't even stay in place for 5 seconds.Everything else about this set it really good. The lights are very bright and can change colors. You can make them stay solid or flash and even dim all at the touch of a button on the remote. The remote control works good but you have to press the buttons hard for some reason or it doesn't want to register.Overall I was very excited to install this set in my truck and it would have looked awesome if they would stay mounted like they are supposed to.

I have some RC models and just happened to have some 5000mah 12v batteries I could hook up.(NOTE) First time I tried nothing happened. Then I noticed there was a small clear plastic tab sticking out of the remote. The tab ended up being a small sheet of plastic that prevents the remotes coin style battery from accidentally making a connection so it wouldn&#8217;t run out of juice in storage and transit.With the tab removed, the LED strips worked wonderfully. You can choose many color combinations or mix your own plus various flash, pulse, strobe and fade effects.It was while playing with this that I realized that there are a lot more applications for this kind of lighting than just the car. The fade effect between different colors is beautiful and has an ethereal quality. Just for fun I placed them under the yacht on the mantelpiece above the fireplace for some accent lighting and it looks great. A simple 12v AC/DC adapter was all that was needed to hook up the provided LED&#8217;s and control box. The control box already has a standard DC input socket.The LED strips use 3M adhesive strips on the back to attach so decent quality and reliable.So it&#8217;s very easy to set up. The control box uses a standard DC plug socket and probably has some kind of voltage regulator to make sure the LED&#8217;s get the correct amount of energy.  It also has a separate wire approximately a foot  long with a IR receiver for the remote, so you can position it discreetly somewhere. The  remote works very well and the lights make very smooth transitions with a broad spectrum of colors.The strips themselves use a 4 pin configuration male on one end and female on the other.

B00I93BOZ0,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,"So I had the chance to review this, so I installed them in my wifes car at her request. She used to have some LED blue lights that mounted near the floor boards and it looked cool, but that was years ago and a car ago. So I saw this and jumped at it. To install it is very, very easy. the Power cable is very long so I was able to plug it into the center console armrest, then run the power cable down the side and tuck it under the console trim where it meets the carpet and ran it towards the front of the car. I then went up the main center console and stuck the lights to the bottom of the dash where there was a small 1/2 lip. I was afraid this wasn't going to stick well but it actually latched right on and never fell off. I mounted the IR receiver so that she could point the remote at it from the driver seat to change the lights.Once they were installed she really liked it, and I will confirm that these lights are very bright! On the plus side they do have a brightness control so you can dim them very low. She liked them.Now, after a week she asked me to take them out, the reason, when you turn the car on the default color of these lights is bright white. So when she would turn the car on it would flash bright white for a brief second, then the lights would turn back to their last setting. But she really hated that flash of bright white. In the daytime or scenarios where it's a little light out you won't notice this, but if you do a lot of early morning before the sun comes up driving or drive once the sun goes down you'll have this happen to you as well.If you can get over the flash of white, these really are pretty cool, very easy to install.

As long as I have the sensor within a line of sight to the remote we are all fine.  I try to be careful and NOT run with the red or blue lights on so as not to alert our County Mounties of our presence.  It's hard enough impersonating sanity much less an officer of the law.  I enjoy changing the intensity of the lighting and the on/off functions while changing the light colors.Right now, this is a novelty item for us except for providing additional cabin lighting in the rear of the SUV, but I cannot find an ongoing utilitarian use for it.

I have spools of LED lights on hand, and every part to make them work. So why exactly would I order this? As I said, I'm a light nut and I'm curious.  I swear that there are only a couple of factories in the world churning out parts for LED's.  The controller, remote, connectors - these are the same generic ones I have in my parts bins.  So why pay a premium price for this kit? 1) You have a warranty and it ships from the USA. 2) No soldering (and those four tabs are mighty close!), 3) it's ready to go.All the connectors are already soldered in place, you have all the wires and parts you'll need. No guessing n voltage, connectors, compatibility and the like.  Plus the LED strips are black, not white, so they blend in.  If you've ever used self-adhesive LED strips, you know the adhesive is questionable. It works great or it falls off. The LED strips included in this kit use 3M VHB tape. VHB has been voted one of the top 20 inventions of the past 10 years. The stuff bonds to almost anything and stays in place. This is the only LED strip I've seen to use VHB. VHB does take some pressure to adhere, and it increases it's bond over 72 hours. The surface has to be clean, free of waxes and grease, and dry.You can plug this right in to any car outlet. I still call them lighter sockets.  Now, these LED's run on 12 volts.  So if you're handy, you can cut the cable from the car adapter and wire it up directly.  The controller module also contains the sensor for the remote control, and this needs to be line of sight to the remote.  You have about 6 inches of wire to play with, so you can hide the controller and just leave the wire exposed.  The controller attaches with a screw or two sided tape (a square of tape is included). There's also a small strip of two sided tape included.  These are not VHB tape. You'll also need a way to secure the wires. 3M makes some command hooks in clear plastic designed for small wires.  Alternately, if the LED's are out of sight, you can just tie-wrap everything in place (but you'll still need a way to secure the end of the wire with the remote sensor.)You can install this in as little as 30 minutes, or, if you want to hide everything, an hour or so.",5,Simple plug in and go - anyone can do it!,1397952000,0,0,NA,Sylvania 34971 ZEVO Interior LED Strip Kit with Remote,32.89
B00I93BOZ0,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,Nice addition to the interior of any hot teens car...well let me put that another way...not a hot teen...but a teen's hot car!  It installs in fifteen minutes if you're at all adept and it really makes for a kewl light show right inside the car or truck or tank or what have you.  I suggest parking before indulging but that's just common sense and unlike others I still credit the younger generation with having some.  Anyway the point is it really does trick out well!

B00I93BOZ0,AM9APPMIE1BHZ,"While most will probably install these inside the cabin of their vehicle, I used them to illuminate my truck toolbox.  I easily ran 12V to the box and I was able to mount these LED strips to the underside of the toolbox lid.  I have them connected to a normally open push button switch what powers them on when the lid opens.Although I like the white color, they offer easily changeable colors and brightness.  Even if power is cut to the little brain box, it remembers your last selection, so mine always power up nice, bright, and white.The strips adhere well and they are so thin I don't have to worry about them catching on anything.

B00JGM7Z5Q,A1F7YU6O5RU432,"What an awesome idea this board is. It turns your stove top into a handy and very versatile cutting board surface. I didn't realize just how much extra space it gave me until I put to use.By having this bamboo stove top board setting over my burners, it frees up the space I usually use on my counter top with my regular cutting board. With that space free, I'm able to have that much more counter space when cooking, for everything from mixing bowls to food prep. My kitchen is petty small, and counter space is very limited. And on my limited counter space, I have all kinds of kitchen appliances. So I am forever trying to shift things around when I'm cooking. So this cutting board is perfect for my needs. It frees up some of my limited space and makes my whole stove into a giant work space.There are legs on the bottom of the board that you can attach to it and adjust to the height so it's best suited for your needs. Or you can even use this without the legs. However I find the board rests more stable when it sits on the legs, verses resting on the burners.The most complicated thing about this board is deciding where to keep it when you're not using it. It's so large that if you're getting this to help with limited kitchen space (like myself), you'll probably end up leaving it sitting on your stove top much of the time, and then just moving it when you need to use your burners. Alternatively you can keep it inside the oven (when it's not hot/turned on) and store it there while you use your stoves burners. I tend to do this and find it works well, since it's a perfect fit.",5,Turn you stove top into a giant cutting board,1405814400,0,0,NA,NA,65.89
B00JGM7Z5Q,A397CWU6DM3O5G,"The work surface is nice size, and built well. It is nice to be able to add some working space when needed. There are four legs underneath, and their position can be adjusted. They have rubber feet, and the screw supposed to be buried in the rubber entirely. It is not very obvious on the first sight, and the instructions provided are not clear with tiny fuzzy pictures - but if you take a leg apart - you will see there is indentation in the rubber for the screw head, so when installed correctly, metal would not stick out at all and the surface underneath would be completely safe from scratches.I was impressed by how carefully the thing was packed - with folded cardboard inserts to follow the shape of the board so it would be safe in transit.",5,"The work surface is nice size, and built well",1404777600,1,1,NA,NA,65.89
B00JGM7Z5Q,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,"I have a small kitchen, so using the stove top as a work surface has become a way of life for me.  I was curious as to how the Camco 2 Burner Bamboo Work Surface would be better than a heavy wooden cutting board balanced across two burners.It is.  The legs were easily installed and just as easily adjusted to fit my burners.  I have a Fridgidaire gas stove and the burner grates are very large.  I was impressed that the legs of the Work Surface could accommodate them.  What it does is create a very stable surface and there's no danger of the thing slipping, tilting, or otherwise sending food flying.The thing is handsome looking, as well.  I understand bamboo is very durable, but will treat it periodically with mineral oil, just as I do my other wooden kitchen accoutrements like cutting boards and salad bowls.  Count me very impressed.This would make a great gift for someone living in a small apartment!",5,Wonderful kitchen asset!,1404259200,1,1,NA,NA,65.89
B00JGM7Z5Q,A3SD3E6FIS6CS9,"If you've ever needed a little more work space in your kitchen, you will want to check out this bamboo stove top cover. We have a 4-burner gas stove, and it fit beautifully over the burners. Not only does it look great, but it also is fully functional as a cutting board or prep surface. It's easy to clean and durable.Originally, I had planned on trying this out in our travel trailer, but after setting it up (attaching the rubber legs), I put it on our stove in the house. My husband liked it so much that it's become a permanent addition to our inside kitchen. If we can find the right size, we'll probably be purchasing an additional one for the travel trailer.The bamboo stove cover has 4 rubber feet which you attach upon receipt of the unit. The unit itself measures 29.5&#34; X 21.25&#34;.  The rubber feet raise the work surface off the stove surface approximately 2&#34;. The front of the work surface has an approximately 1.75&#34; piece of bamboo which hides the burners from view. You need to make sure the burners are completely cool before using this. The groove around the outer portion of the bamboo work surface helps keep juices from overflowing onto the stove. It's easy to clean which is a must if you're using it as a cutting board.The bamboo stove top work surface is light weight, sturdy, and nice looking. It appears to be something that will last for a good while with proper care.",5,Beauty Meets Function,1405900800,0,0,NA,NA,65.89
B00JGM7Z5Q,A376OJHLE6SU9Q,"Thin,light weightDurableBeautifulThis is a MUCH larger stove top cover than I would expect from Camco.  that plus much lighter.  The one I currently have in my RV is one heavy solid piece of wood that does not move when traveling.  I suspect the legs on this unit might help keep it in place if placed within the burner grates however it is still so light I would expect it to come off.  Also this is MUCH too large for my RV.What is is PERFECT for is to cover up a bad spot next to my skin on the kitchen counter!This cutting board has a very thin edge to it.  It also has a &#34;face&#34; or &#34;lip&#34; that butts up against the front edge of the counter.  This makes it a perfect cutting board to place over an unsightly area of counter top.",5,I love this for my home kitchen counter top,1405555200,0,0,NA,NA,65.89
B00JGM7Z5Q,A25QJBK33C4O0R,"Wife 2.0 has never much cared for the kitchen in our home.  It's not that well laid out, but being in a mobile home, even if it's a double-wide, you don't get that much choice for how things get laid out.  Either way, we have a plethora of appliances and other semi-permanent residents on our counters (knife set, jars/canisters that hold the nylon cooking utensils, the Keurig brewer, the dish-strainer/drying rack, etc.) that leave things more cluttered than she'd prefer.  While it doesn't bother me that much to have to clean up between the various items that I'm prepping, nor to work in tighter quarters, I know it frustrates her, so seeing this item show up as something I might be able to test out and review, I jumped at the opportunity.I would note that it shipped inside of a box with plenty of cardboard above and below, and surrounding on either end, that should keep it from being damaged during shipping.  That box was shipped to me inside of another bigger box.  I'm not certain that would be the case for most purchasers, but if it is, then the outer box would be -- most definitely -- a waste of cardboard and paper.  Hopefully buyers recycle the box and materials.Also inside of the box was a small page of instructions.  Basically a single side of a single card that tells you to push the bolts down and through the legs so that the bolt heads can slide into the tracks on the bottom of this work surface.  Once that has been done, you might have to loosen the bolts up slightly, but then you should be able to slide the bolt heads down into the tracks and position the legs where you want them before tightening them back up.The legs are plastic and rubber/nylon combined.  A portion is plastic, while another portion is rubber/nylon.There's a warning carved into the underside of the work surface that notes that you cannot and should not put the work surface down on a hot stove surface.  The wood would be flammable and the legs could potentially melt or catch fire as well.Work surface wise, the 2 burner cover is relatively nice.  It offers a good amount of additional work surface and/or a nice cutting board area that can be used as desired.  Unfortunately it also cuts down by half (at least in my home's case) the amount of burner space you would have available in your home.  Worse, for me, is that if I place this work surface on my stove and intend to use the oven with whatever I'm preparing, I have to be careful again since the back of my gas stove gets quite warm in that area (it vents heat on the back of the stove top, behind the burner area, under the clock/control area).  Given how hot that area can get, it could be very dangerous to leave this work surface on top of the stove with the oven on and heated to higher temps.Even if the work surface can withstand the higher temps back on the back portion of the stove surface, I would still recommend being careful as any food items you work with there will be heated up and that could allow bacteria to multiply before you put food in the oven to cook it properly.Assuming you aren't going to run into these issues, or that you've been well informed about them or have thought about them yourself, then I don't see any reason not to recommend this item for purchase.  I can't say it would be perfect for everyone, but I think it serves a purpose and would do so relatively well.  4 stars from this reviewer.",4,"Additional counter space, but have to be a little careful in use...",1403654400,4,8,NA,NA,65.89
B00JGP8I1S,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,"I live in a very sunny climate.  At least once per week, in the evenings at dusk, I have to drive with my hand shielding my eyes, straining to see the cars in front of me with bright sun streaming directly into my eyes. Crossing long bridges over open water with small curbs between me and the water below, and not being able to see, is risky and something I face frequently. So I consider this a necessity now that I know about it.This cuts out all glare.  It has a clip that fits over the visor.  The top sunshade flips down for daytime and a second one flips down over the first one for night.  It extends down far enough so that most of the viewing surface of the windshield is covered.  It blocks out none of the view.  It eliminates the dangerous glare from sun and oncoming headlights at night on a dark hiway.When you get this item there are removable films on each side of both visors and these need to be removed before you use it.  Reading some of the reviews it looks like some people were not aware of this and tried to use this with the protective films still on.  They are not noticeable when you receive this but you will definitely need to remove these before use.I still use my polarized sunglasses in the daytime which reduces about 70% of the glare, and this eliminates all the rest.  Those evening drives to the west with the sun's rays beaming directly into my eyes no longer bother me.  I consider this a necessity.  I'm delighted with it and grateful that I was given a  sample to try out in exchange for a review.",5,Stops the glare from sun or at night,1404691200,2,2,Idea Village,HD Vision Visor - The Day and Night Visor for your car,15.38
B00JGP8I1S,A1T1YSCDW0PD25,"This is an interesting product. It definitely has its pluses and minuses. I can see some people liking it and some people hating it.There is a certain benefit to looking through this visor. Things do seem a little easier to see and easier on the eyes however there are some potential issues:* Glare & reflections can be a problem (though using polarized sunglasses really cuts back on it)* Accidentally hitting it with certain arm movements can be annoying, and it may get in the way of using solar shields* Positioning it well takes a little effort but probably not a lot* Vibrations while driving can be distracting* Because it only covers part or your view when looking straight ahead, it might be distracting. When looking left or right there is no filter, but looking straight ahead there is. Some people might not mind this but I can see some people really not liking it.* You have to deal with possible dirt and smudges and cleaning it.. I would recommend keeping a nice micro-fiber cloth handy, and moving the visor by its edges to avoid fingerprintsOther:* Remember to remove the protective film covers before use.Because of the issues with it, I'm giving it 3 stars. You just have to try it to see if you like it.

B00JGP8I1S,A34BZM6S9L7QI4,"This actually works pretty well. The yellow really makes things brighter at night, more crisp looking. And the brown lens is kind of like blue-blocker sunglasses for daytime.The reason I knock this one star is because I drive an FJ Cruiser, which is an SUV. The visor clip holds this too high on the windshield. Adjusting the visor downward kind of blocks my vision. I am 5'10, so it isn't a matter of me sitting too low in my seat, it really is that the visor in my truck is higher than in a car.I tried it in a friends Cadillac and it worked really well.Sample provided.",4,Not Great for SUV,1404604800,2,2,Idea Village,HD Vision Visor - The Day and Night Visor for your car,15.38
B00JGP8I1S,AYB4ELCS5AM8P,"This is a vision visor for the car. It has two visors, one for day time and one for night time. Be sure to remove the plastic protection sheet on both sides of each visor (4 sheets in all). You flip them down one and a time or fold them up when not using them.The clip fits on my visor nicely and they are fairly stiff so you don't want to move them when you are driving as you'll need both hands to do it. The day time one does a good job of cutting down glare but it can be distracting as it doesn't cover everything, only what's in front of you. I've found the best time for using it is during rush hour when you're at a crawl or when you are stopped and the Sun is absolutely glaring at you. At that time, it's worth its weight in gold.The night time one is OK at reducing glare. Again, it's not for use at all times but when I'm driving down a certain one lane road where oncoming lights is a problem, it works great.It folds up fine but it prevents me from using the mirror in my visor and my second visor. My car has two visors so I can move one to the window. When I put this on, I can't use the second visor or the mirror.Overall, this is not a panacea but it's good for selective usage. As I mentioned, when you're sitting in a hot car or stopped on a freeway with a hot Sun this is absolutely what you want to have.

I drive a minivan and found that it sat just a little too high for hitting the center of my vision. Which means that depending on the height of the person driving, it may or may not be in a good position. There is currently no way to adjust the height, just the angle.The daytime visor is good and is like looking though tinted sunglasses. I hate night glare so the night visor was also good for cutting that down.I just found that the size was limiting and I had to keep craning my neck to get it so that it wasn't a distraction but a natural part of looking through the windshield.I was provided a sample for testing and review.",3,Does What it Promises but Size is a Limitation,1405468800,1,1,Idea Village,HD Vision Visor - The Day and Night Visor for your car,15.38

You really have to keep your eyes focused in the area of the HD Vision to really get the impact.Another issue is surface area of the HD Vision. Don't get me wrong, the daylight visor and the night are good at reducing glare and could remove your need for sunglasses, except... you still have to look around yourself. This means when you look out of your window, look in your rear view mirror or elsewhere, you lose the effect. This means the usefulness is only for facing forwards. The only way to fix this would be to offer say, an adhesive film for the side windows and rear window.It's a nice idea. It's a flawed execution. In the end, I would say just wear sunglasses during the day and at night, well, the HD Vision is OK, but still has the same drawbacks as it has during the day.",3,"works, but has limitations you may not want to compromise for",1404345600,1,1,Idea Village,HD Vision Visor - The Day and Night Visor for your car,15.38
